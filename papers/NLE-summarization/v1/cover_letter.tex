\opening{Dear Dr. Ruslan Mitkov,} 

I am pleased to submit an original research article entitled 
"Reducing Repetition in Convolutional Abstractive Summarization" by Yizhu Liu, Xinyue Chen, Xusheng Luo and Kenny Q. Zhu 
for consideration for publication in \textit{Natural Language Engineering}. 
Abstractive Summarization is one of the most challenging and interesting problems 
in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
It is a process of generating a concise and meaningful summary of text from multiple text resources 
such as news articals.
The neural-based abstractive summarization always produces repetitive sentences.
This manuscript finds two possible reasons behind the repetition problem in neural-based abstractive summarization: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The models always attend to the same location in source.
\item The models may attend to similar but different sentences in source. 
\end{itemize}
In response, we propose a section-aware attention mechanism (ATTF) and a sentence-level backtracking decoder (SBD).

In this manuscript, we show that the proposed model benefits the quality of generated abstractive summaries.
ATTF and SBD can generate more readable summaries, which are free of grammatical and factual errors
as well as logically consistent with source document.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms multiple baselines.
 
We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by
\textit{Natural Language Engineering}
because it belongs to the topic of text information extraction and text generation. 
In addition, our manuscript finds the reason for repetition in neural-based abstractive summarization.
This may help to extract important information of texts and generate new texts.
We also present two new evaluation metrics for future work in this research area.

This manuscript has not been published and is not under
consideration for publication elsewhere. 
If you feel that the manuscript is appropriate for your journal, 
we suggest the following reviewers: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[-] Seung-won Hwang (seungwonh@yonsei.ac.kr)
	\item[-] Haixun Wang (haixun@gmail.com)
	\item[-] Wentao Wu (Wentao.Wu@microsoft.com)
	\item[-] Eric Lo (ericlo@cse.cuhk.edu.hk)
\end{enumerate}
Thank you for your consideration!

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
