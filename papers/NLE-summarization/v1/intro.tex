\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Abstractive summarization is the task of creating a short, accurate,
informative and fluent summary from a longer text document.
It attempts to reproduce the semantics and topics of original text
by paraphrasing. 
Recently, sequence to sequence
models~\citep{RushCW15,ChopraAR16,NallapatiZSGX16,SeeLM17,PaulusXS17}
have made great progress on abstractive summarization.
Recent study~\citep{bai2018empirical} suggests that, 
without additional, complicated structures or features,
convolutional sequence to sequence 
(CNN seq2seq) models~\citep{gehring2017convs2s,FanGA18,LiuLZ18} 
are more effective and can be trained much faster due to 
its intrinsic parallel nature compared to recurrent networks (RNN).
Furthermore, unlike RNN-based models, 
the convolutional models have more stable gradients 
because of its backpropagation paths. 
Thus, we take CNN seq2seq models as the target model to improve on and
compare with
in this paper.

Unfortunately, just like RNN-based models, CNN-based models also produce
summaries with substantial repeated word sequences which impacts the reading efficiency.
\tabref{tab:example} illustrates one 
test case from the CNN/Daily Mail summarization dataset. 
In this case, the basic CNN produces two 
identical sentences (italized) in the result. 
Unlike machine translation or paraphrasing in which the output words
and input words are almost one-to-one aligned, the output of summarization
is ``compressed'' from the input document. Naturally, every sentence or 
word sequence in the summary corresponds to one or more places in the source
document. If there were two identical word sequences in the summary,
they might be looking at and summarizing the same ``spots'' in the source.
This is evident from the attention map for the three sentences generated by 
CNN, shown in \figref{fig:attn_map}. The 1st and 3rd sentences attend to
the same location in the source (red boxes), while the second
sentence attends to another separate location in the source (green box). 
The two attention maps in the red boxes are very similar.

Driven by this intuition, a few efforts have been made on ``remembering''
what has been focused on before at decoding. 
For example, 
\cite{PaulusXS17} and 
\cite{FanGA18} use intra-temporal 
attention~\citep{NallapatiZSGX16} as well as intra-decoder attention to avoid
attending to the same parts in the source by 
revising attention scores while decoding. 
\cite{SeeLM17} and \cite{GehrmannDR18}
respectively propose coverage mechanism and coverage penalty,
which records the sum of attention distributions of all previously generated words 
%to keep track of what has been summarized in different way.  
in a different way to track the summarized information.  
While these approaches discourage repetition to some extent,
they do so in an indirect manner. That is, they do not 
make use of the attention information in source directly.
Consequently, they may still generate repeated phrases, 
especially in long sentences (shown in the first 5 sections of
\tabref{tab:strong_methods}).

In this paper, we propose an attention filter mechanism that directly 
redistributes the attention from each word in the output summary to the source. 
It does so by computing the parts of interest (POIs) in the source
per segment in the summary~
%\footnote{In this paper, a segment means a sentence or clause delimited by punctuation.}, 
and then minimizing the attention scores of
words in these POIs that have already been attended to by the preceding 
segments during decoding. 
A segment means a sentence or clause delimited by punctuation,
which carries syntactic and semantic information. 
It is very simple but effective. Since punctuations 
play an important role in written language to organize 
the grammatical structures and to clarify the meaning of sentences~\citep{briscoe1996,Kim19,LiWE19}
Specifically, we calculate the attention in terms of segments, larger semantic units than tokens, 
which intuitively helps with emphasis of attention and POIs in source.
Different segments in summary thus do not attend to the same semantic spots
of source, and repetition is reduced. 
This is different from previous approaches
which all do not exactly pinpoint these parts in the source,
which we believe is critical in reducing repetition. 
%This kind of partial attention 
%can help us to pinpoint the corresponding location that each segment is
%attending to. Then we use attention filter to filter
%a partial attention from normal attention of each tokens in the other sections
%by minimizing the attention scores of attended location in source document.
%This can optimize the alignment relationship between source document and 
%summarization.  This is shown in \tabref{tab:attn_exp}. 

Despite the above effort, there are cases, where similar sentences 
exist in the same source document:
\begin{example}
\label{ex:repeatsrc}
%\fbox{
%\parbox{0.9\columnwidth}{
\small{``..the standout fixture in the league on saturday sees leaders 
	   chelsea welcome manchester united ... chelsea midfielder oriol romeu, 
\textbf{currently on loan at stuttgart}, ... romeu is 
\textbf{currently on a season-long loan at bundesliga side stuttgart.}''} 
%}}
\end{example}

In this case, even if the decoder attends to different POIs of 
source document as it produces words, repetition may still result.  
At different timesteps,
the decoder may attend 
to sentences that are similar in different positions.
One potential solution to this is semantic cohesion loss~\citep{elikyilmazBHC18}
which takes the cosine similarity between two consecutively generated sentences
as part of the loss function. It may attend to the same POI
and generate similar sentences (SCL row in \tabref{tab:strong_methods}).  
The other is a trigram decoder~\citep{PaulusXS17} 
which directly forbids repetition of previously generated trigrams at test time. 
While this simple but crude method avoids the repeat of any kind
completely, 
it ignores the fact that \textit{some amount of repetition} may exist
in natural summaries.  
On the other hand, the meddling of the beam search at run-time causes another problem: 
it tends to generate sentences that are logically incorrect. 
In \tabref{tab:strong_methods} (TRI row), the defender dayot didn't
really play for France, according to the source.
That is, the subject and object are mismatched.
So in this paper, we instead introduce a {\em sentence-level} backtracking decoder
that prohibits the repeat of the same sentence at test time.
Our summary produced for the example is shown in last section of 
\tabref{tab:strong_methods}.

%In multiple-sentence summarization task, we observe that more often than not, repetition 
%occurs in the form of the same or similar sentences, rather than repetitive phrases 
%inside sentences. 
%On the other hand, it is prone to grammatical and factual errors(\tabref{tab:attn_exp}).
%Because it detects repetitive trigrams only by setting the 
%probability of the third word to zero. 
%It ignores that there are some same N-gram in the target summaries.
%The natural generation of a sentence is disturbed, giving rise to, 
%for example, mismatch of subject and object, and wrong phrases. 
%summarization is not a text generation problem which are are almost
%one-to-one correspondence between input and output words, it requires the model 
%has the ability to decide where to attend and where to ignore.
%The reason for repetition in abstractive summarization based on CNN seq2seq models is
%that the models always attend to the same location in the source document.
%As shown \tabref{tab:attn_exp} 
%and \figref{fig:attn_map} are corresponding. 
%Sentence in blue has factual erro. and \figref{fig:attn_map}.
%In the attention map, the darker color, the higher attention score.
%the repeated sentence in summary attends to the same location
%with high attention score, and different sentences attend to different location in source document. 
%

%Zhou~\cite{ZhouYWZ17} pointed out that there is no obvious alignment relationship 
%between the source text and the target summary, 
%and the encoder outputs contain noise for the attention. 
%Thus, removing repetition in abstractive summarization on CNN seq2seq model
%need a strong attention mechamism that can get alignment relationship
%between source document and target summary and determine the summarized
%parts in source documents directly. 


Reducing repetition in abstractive summarization provides high-quality summaries for users and improves their reading efficiency.
We expect that other natural language generation (NLG) tasks with repetition problem can be enhances with our approach. 
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We identify the repetition problem in abstractive summaries generated
by CNN seq2seq models and find the reasons behind the repetition problem.
\item We propose new metrics to evaluate this problem: Repeatedness and Readability.
\item We propose an effective approach that redistributes attention scores 
during training time, and prevents repetition by sentence backtracking
at runtime to reduce repetition in CNN seq2seq model.
\item Our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNN-based baselines 
substantially by all evaluation metrics, including ROUGE scores, 
repeatedness and readability.
\end{enumerate}
