\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We analyze two possible reasons behind the repetition problem in abstractive
summarization: (1) attending to the same location in source,
and (2) attending to similar but different sentences in source. 
In response, 
we \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{present }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{presented two methods to modify existing CNN seq2seq model, i.e.,
}\DIFaddend a section-aware attention mechanism (ATTF)
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as well as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and }\DIFaddend a sentence-level backtracking decoder (SBD).

It means that the summaries generated by our model are more accurate and

saving the reading time and improving reading efficiency.
