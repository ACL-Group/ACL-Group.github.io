Metastases mostly disseminate late from primary breast tumors, keeping most drivers
Drivers at relapse sample from a wider range of cancer genes than in primary tumors
Mutations in SWI-SNF complex and inactivated JAK-STAT signaling enriched at relapse
Mutational processes similar in primary and relapse; radiotherapy can damage genome
