We provide the complete templates in Table \ref{table:bdi}. We mainly use a combination of 3 direct depression descriptions and the 21 indirect symptoms derived from BDI-II. We also experimented other well-known depression scales like HDRS \citep{hamilton1986hamilton}, CES-D \citep{Lenore1977CES-D} and PHQ-9 \citep{kroenke2001phq} (We will release our revised templates for theses scales along with our code). The original scales usually contain different descriptions under the same dimension to distinguish different level of intensity or frequency. However, we find that current sentence representations have difficulty in capturing such nuanced differences. We thus condense the descriptions of each dimension into one general template (A few may have more, if there are significant intra-dimension difference).
