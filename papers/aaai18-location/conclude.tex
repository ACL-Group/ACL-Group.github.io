\section{Conclusion}
%This paper proposes to identify \lnear\ relation from literature text and
%construct a knowledge base of object pairs that would commonly appear near
%each other in real world.
We presented a novel study on enriching \lnear\ relationship from corpora. 
Based on our two newly-collected benchmark datasets, we proposed several baseline methods to solve 
the object co-location classification problem. 
We showed that existing methods do not work as well on this task and discovered that LSTM-based model does not have significant edge over 
simpler feature-based model. However, our multi-level sentence normalization turns out to be useful. %The models presented here can be 
%improved because they cannot take advantage of large amount of training
%data. Once this is solved, we will consider in future a bootstrapping framework
%that dynamically updates the model as more positive facts are extracted and
%used as training data.
