human eval:
    correctness->readability (eval.tex/Experimental Setup)

repeatedness: n-gram、sentence、total (eval.tex/Experimental Setup)

scalability:
    maxlen of summaries (eval.tex//Results/Accuracy)

See and Paul: (eval.tex/Results/Accuracy)
    The reason for the improvement of ROUGE scores in See and Paul is that
	repetitve reduction is a part of their summarization task.
    Our work is to reduce repetition.
