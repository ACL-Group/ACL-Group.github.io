I would like to acknowledge to Professor Kenny Zhu, my advisor, for his help during this project. He came up with many great ideas when we doing this research, some of them inspired me a lot.

I also want to say thanks to my fianc\'{e}e Biman Tang. As another team member of this project, she has done most of the coding work in text analysis part. And we often discuss the details of our project, it helped me a lot.
