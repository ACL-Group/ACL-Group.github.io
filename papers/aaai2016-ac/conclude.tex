\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We developed a data-driven approach that automatically
infers a set of argument concepts for a verb by abstracting from a large
number of argument instances parsed from raw text.
These argument concepts are human-readable and machine-computable,
and can be used to represent the meaning of the verb.
Our evaluation demonstrates that the concepts inferred are
accurate to the human judges and show good potential at
identifying correct arguments for verbs even though such
arguments have never been seen before. This work can also
be seen as mining predicate relations between abstract noun
concepts from a taxonomy.
