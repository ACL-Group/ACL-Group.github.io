This paper proposes a novel framework of
deducing causality by automatically harvesting a 
causality network (CausalNet) of causal-effect terms (or causality evidences)
from a large web corpus. 
CausalNet is the first (to the best of our
knowledge) automatically constructed graph-based
representation of causality knowledge base.
This data-driven approach enables
a high coverage including long-tailed causality
relations. 
We then propose a novel metric leveraging both sufficiency and
necessary causality evidences
to model the causality strength 
between terms. 
These metrics between terms can be aggregated for
determining causality
between short texts (e.g., phrases and sentences).
Our evalyation results validate our proposed framework, which outperforms
the previous best approach for solving the competitive SEMEVAL task
known as COPA.
