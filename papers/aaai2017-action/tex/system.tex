\section{System}

We build an online search engine to demonstrate our system.
\figref{fig:demosite} is a screenshot of the demo. This demo provides
primary interface for searching news via action related queries.
The website consists of three columns to show the searching
result, a search bar for entering query and a collection of example queries.

In order to make use of our action-noun map, we need to extract the action
instances in our news corpus, and consider that action instance to be one occurrence of the
noun concept as well. For example, a piece of news containing verbal phrase like
``U.S. invaded Iraq'' will be indexed to its corresponding noun concept ``war'', even if it might not contain ``war'' explicitly.
The noun concepts extracted are indexed in an independent filed to enable weight tuning.

To implement LDA based search, the server will calculate the relatedness between user's query and topics according
to their word distribution, then this extra information will be sent together with the query to ElasticSearch.
 We also index the topic distribution for each piece of news. The final score for each document is composed of the relatedness
 between the query and topics, as well as the topic distribution of each document.
