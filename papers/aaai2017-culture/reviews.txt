Dear Kenny Zhu,

We regret to inform you that your paper, "Mining Cultural Differences of Named Entities from Large Text" (#626), has not been accepted for presentation at the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-17). The competition was very strong this year, with a record-number of 2,590 submissions and only 638 papers accepted, for an acceptance rate of below 25%. Attached to this message are the reviews of your submission, which we hope will explain the result and provide useful feedback on your work.

If you indicated that you would like your paper to be considered for a AAAI-17 workshop, then your submission and the reviews will be made available to the chairs of the workshop that you specified. We expect that workshop chairs will contact the authors of submissions selected for presentations in their workshops around November 18.

We understand that every paper is the result of the careful thought and hard work of its authors. Due to the large number of high-quality submissions, we were forced to reject many interesting and deserving papers. Every AAAI-17 submission received at least two (and 99% at least three) reviews, provided by over 1300 members of the program committee (all PhD researchers with extensive AI publication experience) as well as additional auxiliary reviewers under the supervision of PC members. The review process for each paper was overseen by one of 168 senior program committee members or special track co-chairs, who monitored the reviews of the papers and initiated discussion after the author feedback period. Reviewers read and discussed the author response, and in many cases additional reviews were collected. Discussions were often very detailed and, in most cases, led to resolution of issues brought up by the reviewers. For the main technical track, senior program committee mem!
 bers wrote a meta-review summarizing the recommendation and providing further explanation where required. Finally, the program co-chairs and track chairs decided the papers to include in the program.

Whereas the program committee expended tremendous effort in an attempt to be as fair and accurate as possible, we recognize that the conference reviewing process is inherently limited. Evaluation is subject to random and subjective factors, and no doubt many decisions could have justifiably gone the other way. We wish you well in finding an appropriate publication forum for your work.

We also hope that despite this submission outcome you will be able to join us at the conference in San Francisco. In addition to the outstanding technical program, AAAI-17 continues the tradition of a series of prominent invited speakers and panels, an extensive demo program, state-of-the-field presentations by senior members of the AAAI community, a "What's Hot" track highlighting the best work from sister conferences and competitions, and other special events. For more details on all AAAI-17 events, please see http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai17.php.

Sincerely,

Satinder Singh and Shaul Markovitch
AAAI-17 Program Co-Chairs

PAPER: 626
TITLE: Mining Cultural Differences of Named Entities from Large Text
AUTHORS: Hanyuan Shi, Kenny Zhu, Bill Lin, Frank Xu and Seungwon Hwang

Significance: 2 (modest or incremental contribution)
Soundness: 3 (correct)
Scholarship: 3 (excellent coverage of related work)
Clarity: 2 (more or less readable)
Breadth of Interest: 3 (some interest beyond specialty area) SUMMARY RATING: 1 (+ (weak accept))

----------- Summarize the Main Contribution of the Paper ----------- This work proposed a method for capturing cross-lingual cultural difference of the same named entities. It used image-retrieval results as an indicator for recognizing the cultural difference and made ground truth by hand. This paper is well-written and well-structured.

----------- Comments for the Authors ----------- There are several concerns as follows.
1. The cultural difference in this paper seems just difference in things of interest in different countries. As mentioned in the paper, countries nearby China and their related stuffs would be more frequently mentioned in Chinese new papers rather than English ones.

2. Though it may be difficult, it would be possible to automatically build training data by comparing image retrieval results for the same named entities in differen languages by machine. 

3. Sentimental analysis on the cultural difference may give interesting results. For a named entity, Chinese newspapers are in the negative stand while English newspapers stand on the positive side.

PAPER: 626
TITLE: Mining Cultural Differences of Named Entities from Large Text
AUTHORS: Hanyuan Shi, Kenny Zhu, Bill Lin, Frank Xu and Seungwon Hwang

Significance: 2 (modest or incremental contribution)
Soundness: 1 (major errors)
Scholarship: 2 (relevant literature cited but could expand)
Clarity: 2 (more or less readable)
Breadth of Interest: 3 (some interest beyond specialty area) SUMMARY RATING: 1 (+ (weak accept))

----------- Summarize the Main Contribution of the Paper ----------- This paper proposes a method to identify cultural differences among entities based on a multi-lingual text corpus. The main claim of the paper is that cultural differences manifest in text and that is possible to detect them using NLP processing and translation techniques. The topic proposed by the authors is interesting and relevant to the AAAI community. However, I have several concerns about the assumptions made in the paper, the improvements of the techniques proposed, the original contribution of the paper and the robustness of the results obtained (see comments below)

----------- Comments for the Authors ----------- The paper has two main problems:
1)	The contribution of this paper seems somehow limited. The authors have proposed to use well-known IR and NLP techniques to detect cultural differences. The original contribution of this paper seems to be limited to the translation space algorithm, which although being original does not result on a significant improvement on performance. 
2)	With regard to the experiments conducted:
-	The claim that the images depicted by different search engines are a good basis for identifying cultural differences is not justified or demonstrated in the paper. How the authors can be sure that these images are a good way of detecting cultural differences?
-	The proposed techniques have been compared with unsophisticated classifiers, which does not seem a fair comparison. A more adequate comparison may be to use semantic features to test a classifier to check the improvement produced by the techniques proposed.  
-	Given the small amount of entities used in the experiments and the small improvement achieved by the proposed technique (Translation Space) over a Linear Transformation, it is not clear that these results are generalizable or significant.
-	The selection of the corpus used in the experiments is not justified. In particular, one may think if the differences detected may be due to the different opinions and editorial lines of the sources selected, or if there is a cultural difference.

OTHER COMMENTS
-The corpus used is clearly unbalanced (there are more than twice articles in English than in Chinesse), how this can impact the results obtained?
-The claim that a less popular entity is likely to be less controversial is not justified and questionable. There are entities that are not mainstream and  can be more controversial than other mainstream  entities (e.g., Roger Federer may be an entity more popular than Wu Yi, while it is more likely than the second is a more controversial figure). 
- There are a few grammatical mistakes spread in the paper.

PAPER: 626
TITLE: Mining Cultural Differences of Named Entities from Large Text
AUTHORS: Hanyuan Shi, Kenny Zhu, Bill Lin, Frank Xu and Seungwon Hwang

Significance: 2 (modest or incremental contribution)
Soundness: 2 (minor inconsistencies or small fixable errors)
Scholarship: 2 (relevant literature cited but could expand)
Clarity: 2 (more or less readable)
Breadth of Interest: 2 (interest limited to specialty area) SUMMARY RATING: -1 (- (weak reject))

----------- Summarize the Main Contribution of the Paper ----------- This paper formulates a new task of mining cultural differences of name entities in different language, and presents a data-driven approach to perform this task. It is a novel and interesting work. The key idea is that it applies two algorithms to calculate the similarity between two name entities in different language.  Through correlation evaluation, the proposed method gets better results and some baseline methods.  Another good contribution of this paper is that it constructs a ground truth dataset with the help of web search engine.

----------- Comments for the Authors ----------- There are some weaknesses in this paper.
1. This paper just uses many existing simple methods to perform the task.  There are not novel solutions or new ideas to all the problems, such as, entity linking, similarity computation, and so on.
2. It is not easy to follow the "Translation Space Algorithm".  I cannot understand how to translate from x to y and z,  how to calculate the similarity between  W_e and W_c with xy and xz.  Same issues exist in the section of "Linear transformation algorithm".  It will be better to describe the algorithms with pseudocode or flowchart.
3.  The task is interesting. The methods used in this paper are too simple.  It is more like a social science paper.

PAPER: 626
TITLE: Mining Cultural Differences of Named Entities from Large Text

This paper seeks to detect and study cultural differences in the way named entities are described in multi-lingual texts using natural language and IR techniques. While this introduces an interesting problem, the translation-space algorithm studied here is not well described and gives only modest performance gain compared to simple baselines.
