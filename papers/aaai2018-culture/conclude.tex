\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we conclude that the cultural properties and social elements of a term (including both entity names and slang terms) can be effectively embedded by its similarities to social words with the help of our proposed 
\textit{SocVec}, which enables the comparison between two incompatible 
monolingual semantic spaces. 
Our proposed framework can be valuable assistance to cross-cultural 
social studies, acting as a building block for 
computing such cross-cultural differences and similarities. 
The two novel tasks with datasets as well as benchmark results also benefit 
further study in related topics of computational social science.
%, such as detection of cross-cultural differences in named entities and extraction of a bilingual lexicon for Internet slangs.
