\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we introduce a new Recursive Neural Network called \emph{Code-RNN} to extract the topic or function of the source code. This new Recursive Neural Network is the parse tree of the source code and we go through all the tree from leaf nodes to root node to get the final representation vector. Then we use this vector to classify the source code into some classes according to the function, and classification results are acceptable. 
We further propose a new kind of GRU called \emph{Code-GRU} to utilize the vector created from Code-RNN to generate comments. We apply Code-GRU to ten source code repositories and gain the best result in most projects.
This frame work can also be applied to other programming languages as long as we have access to the parse tree of the input program.

%connect the Code-RNN to basic Recurrent Neural Network end-to-end to generate the comments for methods in seven projects. We also propose two Sequence-to-Sequence models to generate comments as baseline, because the models we found that generate comments are all based one fixed template. According to results, Code-RNN outperforms both two Sequence-to-Sequence models.

As future work, we can add call graphs into our model,
so that Code-RNN can contain invocation information and extract more topics
from source code.
%And our Code-GRU can be used in many other domains as long as they have representation vector.
