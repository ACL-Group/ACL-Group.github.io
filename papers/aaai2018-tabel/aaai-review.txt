Title	Cross-Lingual Entity Linking for Web Tables

Question	 
[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.	This paper addresses a variant of the entity linkage (EL) problem, where surface mentions in a table in one language need to be disambiguated into a table of entities in a knowledge base in another language. (There has been work on cross-lingual EL, and mono-lingual table EL). It aims to avoid the imbalance of Chinese and English Wikipedia coverage, by first translating mentions directly into English. And it uses neural networks, rather than graphical models for the task.
[Relevance] Is this paper relevant to an AI audience?	Relevant to researchers in subareas only
[Significance] Are the results significant?	Moderately significant
[Novelty] Are the problems or approaches novel?	Somewhat novel or somewhat incremental
[Soundness] Is the paper technically sound?	Technically sound
[Evaluation] Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?	Somewhat weak
[Clarity] Is the paper well-organized and clearly written?	Good
[Detailed Comments] Please elaborate on your assessments and provide constructive feedback.	The algorithm scores alternatives using three components: mention (dealing with individual cells), context (considering cells in the same column and row), and coherence (how sensible is it to co-locate entities in the same column).

At least one if not both of context and coherence appear in Bhagavatula et al., Section 3.3: "...achieve higher accuracy by preferring sets of disambiguations that are coherent (i.e. sets composed of related entities)", "...soft constraints encourage disambiguations of mentions in the same row and column to be related to one another." "We represent a table, T, as a graphical model in which each potential mention is associated with a discrete random variable, whose possible values are its _candidate entities_." This should be explicitly acknowledged during the presentation in Section 3. The contribution of this paper might be defining context of mentions the average of its row & column embeddings (though these also use entities?), and limiting entity context to columns.

Concerning the evaluation of the resulting system:
- Since there are no previous cross-lingual table ELs, the first experiments with TabEL_B and TabEL_W are reasonable, and show the power of using more than one translation
- Since the paper does (nicely) compare mono-lingual table ELs on their own ground (Table 3), it would be more reasonable to compare with TabELB on its own English dataset.
- When evaluating against Zhang et al (or Tsai&Roth) there is the issue that they seem to only deal with entities occurring in both Wikipedia's - a problem this paper aims to avoid. How is this handled in the experiment? [It would seem reasonable to have one dataset with entities in both Wikipedias, and one with no such restriction.] And why not try to use the (dated) [McNamee et al'11], which also does direct term translation, but using a current, much better translator in it? More generally, why doesn't the evaluation talk about the case of mentions that have no entry in Chinese Wikipedia, since this is ?

More generally:
* it is unfortunate that, unlike Tsai&Roth, this work was not tested on more than one language pair
* given the sizes mentioned at the beginning, it would have been reasonable to hear something about the efficiency of the algorithm, both in absolute terms and against its non-neural net competitors. (Bhagavatula et al provide an analysis of run-times.)
* although recent papers in NLP on table EL do not do so, it seems rather strange to ignore table headings



PS My score of Marginal+ could have been Accept. Much depends on the avalanche of other NLP papers
[QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] Please provide questions for authors to address during the author feedback period.	Is "coherence feature" really a new contribution as claimed in the paper?

What, if anything, was done with mentions that do not have Chinese Wikipedia entries (another claimed advantage of the approach)?
[OVERALL SCORE]	Marginally above threshold

Question	 
[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.	The paper illustrates a novel approach, based on neural network and bilingual translation, to link entities in a table in a foreign language (chinese in this case) to entities in a knowledge based in a different language (English in this case).
[Relevance] Is this paper relevant to an AI audience?	Relevant to researchers in subareas only
[Significance] Are the results significant?	Moderately significant
[Novelty] Are the problems or approaches novel?	Somewhat novel or somewhat incremental
[Soundness] Is the paper technically sound?	Technically sound
[Evaluation] Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?	Sufficient
[Clarity] Is the paper well-organized and clearly written?	Poor
[Detailed Comments] Please elaborate on your assessments and provide constructive feedback.	The paper illustrates the interesting problem of mapping entities in a table to entities in a knowledge base, crossing barriers caused by the use of different languages in the two contexts. 
The proposed approach seems effective and it is supported by a good experimental evaluation. The comparison with two other recent systems support the claims of the authors.
The presentation in the paper is not always very accessible; some of the notation is taken for granted, making the paper not very self-contained. In particular, section 3.3 could be made more understandable with some examples and intuitions.

[QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHORS] Please provide questions for authors to address during the author feedback period.	1. there is an extensive literature on web table recognition - how could your method help in such direction?
2. would you be able to embed a running example to aid with making the paper more accessible?

Question	 
[Summary] Please summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words.	This paper first defines the problem of cross-lingual entity linking for web tables and proposes a novel neural network. The proposed network contains a translation module and combines mention feature, context feature and coherence feature.
[Relevance] Is this paper relevant to an AI audience?	Likely to be of interest to a large proportion of the community
[Significance] Are the results significant?	Highly significant
[Novelty] Are the problems or approaches novel?	Very novel
[Soundness] Is the paper technically sound?	Technically sound
[Evaluation] Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?	Sufficient
[Clarity] Is the paper well-organized and clearly written?	Excellent
[Detailed Comments] Please elaborate on your assessments and provide constructive feedback.	This paper first defines the problem of cross-lingual entity linking for web tables and proposes a novel neural network. The proposed network contains a translation module and combines mention featrue, context featrue and coherence feature. And the experiments show that the proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly.
At the time of prediction, finding the best configuration is a NP problem. This paper proposes a local-search descent algorithm. However, it is easy to get stuck at locally optimal values which is the main weakness of this paper.
