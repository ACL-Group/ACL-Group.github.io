\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
%In this section, we describe our neural network based joint model for cross-lingual table linking. We first give an overview of our approach, followed by the method for candidate entity generation. Then we describe translation module in detail. Afterwards, we introduce mention, context and coherence features used in our model respectively. In the last part, we discuss the training process and prediction strategy.
