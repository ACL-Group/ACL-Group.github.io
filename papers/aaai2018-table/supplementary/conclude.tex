\section{Conclusion}

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work that studies
the cross-lingual entity linking problem for web tables. We proposed a neural
network based joint model that takes advantage of features extracted from
a cell, its context and semantic coherence within a table column. 
Our experiments show the substantial benefits of using the 
joint model that predicts the links of all cells at once 
versus a non-joint model that predicts the cells independently. Our best
model achieves an accuracy of 63\%, for a task that is significantly more
challenging than mono-lingual table linking. Possible future work includes
the automatic determination of whether a non-numerical string mention in 
a cell should or should not be linked. We have ignored this problem in this
paper but such un-linkable cells are abundant in web tables, too.
