\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:eval}



%In this section, we evaluate our table linking system and compare with other previous works
%on the cross-lingual task.
In this section, we introduce the datasets and state-of-the-art systems used in our experiments,
and explain how to adapt a mono-lingual entity linker into our scenario.
We show the end-to-end results of all the systems on cross-lingual and mono-lingual dataset, 
and perform ablation experiments to investigate the importance of different components used in the whole task.
%Finally, we discuss and analyze the errors in our system.
