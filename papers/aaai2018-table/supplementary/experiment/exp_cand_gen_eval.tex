\subsection{Evaluation of Candidate Generation}
\label{sec:exp-cand-gen-eval}

%In this part, we evaluate the quality of candidate entity generation.

In this part, we investigate the translated English mentions from Chinese table inputs.
As described in \secref{sec:impl-detail}, English mentions are derived from multiple resources.
Compare with different combination of resource, we evaluate the quality by
measuring the proportion of cells that the correct entity appears in the top-$n$ candidates
(Hits@$n$).

From the results in \tabref{tab:cand-gen-quality}, we observe that
ensembling multiple translation resources is able to discover more correct entities without bringing too many noisy candidates.
