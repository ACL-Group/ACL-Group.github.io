%\subsection{Mono-lingual Comparison}
%\label{sec:exp-mono}

For better justifying the effectiveness of our model, we perform experiments on mono-lingual scenario.
We use the original table dataset, where target entities are articles in Chinese Wikipedia.
%Our cross-lingual table linking dataset is constructed from a mono-lingual dataset with help of wikipedia inter-language links.
%Thus the original dataset is suitable for a comparion in mono-lingual settings.
%We remove the translation module in our full model, resulting a mono-lingual joint linking system.
Accordingly, we remove the translation layer in our model for handling the mono-lingual task,
and all the other settings stay the same.
Again we compare with previous table linking systems,
where \textit{$TabEL_W$} is reported as the state-of-the-art in Chinese table linking task.
%We compare our degenerated model with previous mentioned mono-lingual table linking systems \textit{$TabEL_B$} and \textit{$TabEL_W$},
%which gain state-of-the-art result in Chinese table linking tasks.
%The dataset is identical to the cross-lingual dataset, except that all the gold entities are Chinese instead of English.
%All the other settings are the same as cross-lingual task, which is mentioned in the previous sections.
Experimental results in \tabref{tab:mono-result} show that
our mono-lingual model still outperforms the two baselines,
which supports the expressiveness of our NN based joint model for handling general table linking tasks.
%We report the experimental results in ~\tabref{tab:mono-result}.
%Experimental result shows that our mono-lingual model outperforms the other two systems,
%which indicates that nerual network based joint model is good at handling entity linking task for Web tables.
