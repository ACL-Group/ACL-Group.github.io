List 3 or more strong points, labelled S1, S2, ...:	S1. Rare, real, and large-scale data from Cainiao and Taobao. Authors also contributes making it public.

S2. The problem is about a real use case in logistic companies.

S3. The idea of adopting intra-attention to introduce the restriction of the problem is good.
List 3 or more weak points, labelled W1, W2, ...:	W1. Background of the problem is not clear. Not so convincing that the paper chooses the surface minimization as objective of BPP. In common sense, should transportation be equipped with fixed sizes of bins, rather than flexible ones? I suggest there to be intuitive examples of such scenario.

W2. Challenges in real world production. The target is to minimize the surface, and I still doubt if logistic company can make the PE bag in the size of interest as soon as the calculation is done. It is better if the paper introduces logistic companies’ ability to do so.

W3. It is a pity that the technical content is not well written. I’ve mainly two comments. 1)~in Figure2, the data nodes are not labeled, confusing; attention mechanism and likelihood maximization mechanism are not presented; and the arrows between nodes are in a mess. 2)~Figure2’s drawback makes Section4 not so comprehensive to readers.

W4. Performance test procedure seems not theoretically rigorous. It claims in Section4.3.3 that “simply generate multiple candidate solutions per order at inference time and select the best”. Since this system’s output is in distribution format, it is the Statistical Expectation that should be chosen. Otherwise, any distribution can generate the sample of optimal combination, given enough patience. To say the least, the author should give proof of statistical significance of such experiment setting.

This paper defines and solves a new optimization problem, named the new 3D bin-packing problem. Specifically, given some cuboid items, the object is to place them orthogonally to minimize the surface of it, then a combinatorial problem is formulated. This problem is interesting and the authors claim its real use case in reducing the packing cost in e-commerce related logistics. Given the large search space, the paper proposes a seq2seq based method to address this problem, with sizes of cuboid items as input and placing actions as output. Experiments on real-world dataset from Taobao customers’ order data are conducted, with comparisons to a number of heuristic based solutions. 

I like this paper because it nicely formulates the bin-packing problem of a new scenario faced by big logistic companies, and solves this combinatorial optimization problem using well designed LSTM, getting good performance and 

However, due to the lack of detailed introduction of background, I still have some concerns about the practicality of the solution. Please see W1 and W2. The experiment setting seems a little problematic, or at least not sound (see W4). Besides, I suggest the improvements when introducing the detailed solution (see W3).

The paper considers a variant of the combinatorial optimization problem of bin packing where a set of 3d objects have to packed as compactly as possible into one bin with the objective to minimize the bin's surface area. The authors present an approach for this problem based on reinforcement learning which they report to provide superior results over a number of baseline methods on a large number of real-world product packing problems.

While the overall problem is clearly meaningful and it is interesting to see that a machine learning approach can yield competitive or even superior performance, the paper has the problem of a) being only borderline relevant for CIKM as it is actually solving a combinatorial optimization problem (optimization and pure ML conferences would be more appropriate) and b) an insufficient presentation quality which rendered it impossible for me to understand the details of the approach. Especially due the second point I cannot recommend acceptance.

In particular, the paper does neither provide a self-contained introduction to the encoder / decoder architecture (like, e.g., in [1]) nor an overview of the overall training/inference workflow which makes it impossible for an uninformed reader to understand how the various design pieces of the method fit together. This problem is amplified by the fact that the paper contains numerous grammatical errors and wrong word choices (e.g., "we use one line to _demonstrate_ (represent) one customer order", "we _settle_ (disregard) the free space strategy", "_Intuitively_ (formally), the input of the our encoder model can be denoted as", ...).

This paper is very well written, has a very nice and accurate flow.
It contains theoretical discussion, and moves from theory to a very common application. It has a thorough literature review, considers many recent work in domain. It would be very beneficial to have their dataset available.
