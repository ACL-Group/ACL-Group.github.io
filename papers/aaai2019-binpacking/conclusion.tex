\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on a 3D-FBPP, 
in which the objective is to minimize the surface area of the bin 
that can pack all items. Due to the complexity of the problem, 
it is very difficult to obtain optimal solution. If we use DNN to parameterize these decision processes similar to what does in heuristic, we can obtain a more powerful algorithm. Therefore, we apply a multi-task 
selected learning based method to optimize the sequence and orientation of 
items to be packed. The model is trained and tested with a large number of real data. 
Experimental results show that the multi-task selected learning method outperforms a well-designed, effective heuristic algorithm significantly. We will also release a large-scale real-world order
dataset. In the future research, we will focus on investigation of more effective network architecture and training algorithm. In addition, integrating the selection of spatial location into the architecture of neural network is also worthy of study.
