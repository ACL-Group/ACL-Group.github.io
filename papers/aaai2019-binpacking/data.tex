\section{Data Collection}
\label{sec:data}

To the best of our knowledge, available large scale real-world order dataset is very rare, especially with real-sized items. For that purpose, we create a dataset on 3D flexible bin packing problem of real-world E-commerce platform. This LROD consists of two parts: the customer order data is collected from E-commerce platform and item size data (i.e., length, width and height) is collected from Logistics platform. We randomly sampled 150,000 training data and 150,000 testing data for customer orders with 8, 10 and 12 items, which are named as BIN8, BIN10 and BIN12 respectively. This dataset can be used to solve our 3D-FBPP as well as other applications, such as box design. We believe this dataset will contribute to the future research of 3D packing problem. \footnote{The data will be published soon after accepted.}
