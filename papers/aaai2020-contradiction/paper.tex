\begin{abstract}
%Commonsense is very important for human to make judge in daily life. Research in commonsense reasoning has also been developed quickly
%Commonsense of human is always constituted by numerous short descriptions of daily things, such as ``blue sky'' instead of ``green sky'', ``cute baby'' instead of ``sexy baby''. People know whether a vocabulary is suitable to match elements that they have seen. 
%\KZ{General comments: Structure is ok. Motivation part is fine. 
%But the English in this paper needs a lot of polishing. You have to read
%it carefully, sentence by sentence to iron out all the grammar mistakes. Replace all
%" with ``. The refs are all bad now.  Be care with all the font sizes in the figs.
%Make sure they are roughly just 1 pt smaller than main text.}

Commonsense knowledge consists of short and simple concepts about everyday lives such as ``blue sky'' instead of ``green sky'', which all humans agree with.
Incorporating commonsense knowledge to machines is a long-standing challenge to fulfill real artificial intelligence.
Unlike previous work mainly focusing on inferences between long sentences, we target on short phrases, which is more challenging due to a lack of surrounding context. We construct a new dataset \textbf{CoCo} with over 9,000 pairs of short phrases, which is designed for testing the capability of machines on commonsense reasoning.
Preliminary experiments show that large pre-trained language models such as BERT and ERNIE are still lagging behind human performance to a large margin on CoCo, which indicates that further efforts are needed to enable machines to grasp such commonsense knowledge. 
%are expected to know.\JQ{which all humans agree with}
%To test the capability of machines to do commonsense reasoning,
%we construct a new dataset called \textbf{CoCo}, consisting of over 9,000 pairs of short phrases, so that a machine is asked to distinguish which phrase of each pair is more acceptable by common sense.
%Unlike previous works on commonsense reasoning mainly focusing on the inference between long sentences, 
%our dataset targets on short phrases from daily life in a pairwise form, making it more challenging for machines due to a lack of surrounding context.

%showing that further researches are needed for making neural models have commonsense on short phrase like human.
