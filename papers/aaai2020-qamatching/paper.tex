\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  % Question motivated multi-turn dialogues, such as those between doctors and patients in online discussion forums, are rich in question-answer pairs. These QA pairs are valuable for researches on proactive questioning and dialogue comprehension. However, these real-world online dialogues are often noisy and disordered, and mixed up with questions, answers and chit chats, making it difficult to extract high quality QA pairs. In this work, the proposed pairwise matching models combine the dialogue history in an interleaving way with two parallel attention mechanisms. Experiments show that our models achieve the best results, and are significantly better than previous methods on identifying long-distance QA pairs.


%Two-party question-motivated dialogues from online medical forums are rich 
%sources of question-answer pairs. 
Matching QA relations between two turns in conversations is not only 
the first step in analyzing dialogue structures, 
but also valuable for training dialogue systems. 
This paper presents a QA matching model considering both 
distance information and dialogue history by two simultaneous attention 
mechanisms called mutual attention. 
%\KZ{What do you mean by ``upgraded''? Too much details about the approaches below. Simplify to just 1 sentence.} 
%Two parallel attention mechanisms are used to capture the information flow between two parties, and an one-hot vector with fixed dimension is used to encode the distance before the output layer.
Given scores computed by the trained model between each non-question 
turn with its candidate questions, a greedy matching strategy 
is used for final predictions. %We did experiments on two datasets with 1,000 annotated dialogues respectively and
Because existing dialogue dataset such as the Ubuntu dataset are not 
suitable for the QA matching task, we further create a dataset with 
1,000 labeled dialogues and 
demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art and 
other strong baselines, particularly for
matching long-distance QA pairs.
