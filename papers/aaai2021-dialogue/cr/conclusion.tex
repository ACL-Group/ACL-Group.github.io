\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes the interpersonal relation classification task for interlocutors in dyadic dialogues, accompanied with a new reasonable sized dialogue dataset called DDRel. The cross-session relation classification is raised for the first time and the results of baseline models shows the limitation for current methods on this new task. Models that taking advantages of multiple sessions and commonsense knowledge are expected to be explored as future work.
