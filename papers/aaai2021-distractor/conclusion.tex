\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a configurable distractor generation framework for cloze-style open-domain MCQs. 
Using the proposed framework, we experimentally observe substantial performance gain in terms of distractor reliability and plausibility with less computational footprint. Depending on the characteristics~(e.g. capacity, POS distribution) of different general-purpose knowledge bases, the generated distractors may vary. Importantly, as knowledge bases with larger coverage and more advanced ranker inevitably emerge, they can be expediently integrated into our framework for further performance gain.
