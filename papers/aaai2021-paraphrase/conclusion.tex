\section{Conclusion}
% \KZ{Fix this one: no more ``unsupervised''...}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for automatically paraphrase generation without parallel training data that outperforms most existing methods. While the results are positive, there still remains many problems to be studied. Can we find more underlying semantics? Is there a better evaluation metric than iBLEU? We plan to look into these questions in the future and generate better paraphrases.
