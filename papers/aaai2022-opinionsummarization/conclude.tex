\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work,
we propose a new data creation method to generate
 a semi-structured synthetic training data for 
opinion summarization,
which is known for lacking training data.
\cut{We showed that by extracting an aspect-opinion pairs and 
implicit sentences from multiple reviews
first and then synthesizing them into semi-structured data, we achieve
better performance on opinion summarization.}
%\KZ{It is critical to show in your experiments that the proposed
%synthetic data is better than other possible alternatives.}, 
We also designed an aspect-guided model with opinion-aspect pair encoder and implicit sentence encoder.
The results showed that
the proposed model can make full use of semi-structured data
and generate high-quality summaries.
