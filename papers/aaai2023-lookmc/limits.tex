\section*{Limitations}
There are some limitations in this work that could be addressed in future work. 

First, though our work can reduce short circuits in multiple choice reasoning models, 
there are still more opportunities to apply \textit{crossover} or \textit{mutation} to other 
text generation models for enhancing their performance. 

Second, the short circuit is only one kind of weakness for reasoning models. 
The approach outlined here only attacks short circuits. To tackle other types of
model fragility, more clear interpretations of what models learn are required.
