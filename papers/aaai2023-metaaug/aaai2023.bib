    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

We propose a two-stage model-compression method to reduce a model{'}s inference time cost. We first decompose the matrices in the model into smaller matrices and then perform feature distillation on the internal representation to recover from the decomposition. This approach has the benefit of reducing the number of parameters while preserving much of the information within the model. We experimented on BERT-base model with the GLUE benchmark dataset and show that we can reduce the number of parameters by a factor of 0.4x, and increase inference speed by a factor of 1.45x, while maintaining a minimal loss in metric performance.",

abstract = {Neural networks based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are widely deployed in latency-sensitive language and speech applications. To speed up LSTM inference, previous research proposes weight pruning techniques to reduce computational cost. Unfortunately, irregular computation and memory accesses in unrestricted sparse LSTM limit the realizable parallelism, especially when implemented on FPGA. To address this issue, some researchers propose block-based sparsity patterns to increase the regularity of sparse weight matrices, but these approaches suffer from deteriorated prediction accuracy. This work presents Bank-Balanced Sparsity (BBS), a novel sparsity pattern that can maintain model accuracy at a high sparsity level while still enable an efficient FPGA implementation. BBS partitions each weight matrix row into banks for parallel computing, while adopts fine-grained pruning inside each bank to maintain model accuracy. We develop a 3-step software-hardware co-optimization approach to apply BBS in real FPGA hardware. First, we propose a bank-balanced pruning method to induce the BBS pattern on weight matrices. Then we introduce a decoding-free sparse matrix format, Compressed Sparse Banks (CSB), that transparently exposes inter-bank parallelism in BBS to hardware. Finally, we design an FPGA accelerator that takes advantage of BBS to eliminate irregular computation and memory accesses. Implemented on Intel Arria-10 FPGA, the BBS accelerator can achieve 750.9 GOPs on sparse LSTM networks with a batch size of 1. Compared to state-of-the-art FPGA accelerators for LSTM with different compression techniques, the BBS accelerator achieves 2.3 ~ 3.7x improvement on energy efficiency and 7.0 ~ 34.4x reduction on latency with negligible loss of model accuracy.},

    abstract = "We present BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and other recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa on GLUE and SQuAD, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 3.5 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to understand their effect on end-task performance.",

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

    abstract = "Language model pre-training, such as BERT, has significantly improved the performances of many natural language processing tasks. However, pre-trained language models are usually computationally expensive, so it is difficult to efficiently execute them on resource-restricted devices. To accelerate inference and reduce model size while maintaining accuracy, we first propose a novel Transformer distillation method that is specially designed for knowledge distillation (KD) of the Transformer-based models. By leveraging this new KD method, the plenty of knowledge encoded in a large {``}teacher{''} BERT can be effectively transferred to a small {``}student{''} TinyBERT. Then, we introduce a new two-stage learning framework for TinyBERT, which performs Transformer distillation at both the pre-training and task-specific learning stages. This framework ensures that TinyBERT can capture the general-domain as well as the task-specific knowledge in BERT. TinyBERT4 with 4 layers is empirically effective and achieves more than 96.8{\%} the performance of its teacher BERT-Base on GLUE benchmark, while being 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference. TinyBERT4 is also significantly better than 4-layer state-of-the-art baselines on BERT distillation, with only {\textasciitilde}28{\%} parameters and {\textasciitilde}31{\%} inference time of them. Moreover, TinyBERT6 with 6 layers performs on-par with its teacher BERT-Base.",

Moreover, we introduce a pilot update mechanism to improve the alignment between the inner-learner and meta-learner in meta learning algorithms that focus on an improved inner-learner. Experiments on various benchmarks show that MetaDistil can yield significant improvements compared with traditional KD algorithms and is less sensitive to the choice of different student capacity and hyperparameters, facilitating the use of KD on different tasks and models.",

We present MATE-KD, a novel text-based adversarial training algorithm which improves the performance of knowledge distillation. MATE-KD first trains a masked language model-based generator to perturb text by maximizing the divergence between teacher and student logits. Then using knowledge distillation a student is trained on both the original and the perturbed training samples. We evaluate our algorithm, using BERT-based models, on the GLUE benchmark and demonstrate that MATE-KD outperforms competitive adversarial learning and data augmentation baselines. On the GLUE test set our 6 layer RoBERTa based model outperforms BERT-large.",

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.}
