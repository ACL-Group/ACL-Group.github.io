\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this work, we address the challenges of \textit{DMPC} for giant e-commerce platforms. 
To tackle multiple evolving domains,
% with domain-specific taxonomy classification tasks, 
we propose an unified \textit{TaLR} framework.
% comprising of \textit{Retrieval-Reranking} stages
In order to enhance the semantic space alignment between product titles and class labels, we exploit the concept knowledge to ensure coarse-grained retrieval quality, and contrastively pretrain the model with intra-concept supervision for fine-grained reranking. 
Results under both single-domain and multi-domain conditions exhibit the advantage of \textit{TaLR}, while it further shows generalizability on zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, incorporating concept knowledge to enhance semantic vector matching is enlightening for general text classification.
% (Taxonomy evolving \& New taxonomy). 

% For future works, we will deploy this system in product environment to test its online performance. To assure robustness, We shall also investigate contrastive learning modifications to alleviate the performance drop when node $divide$ happens. 
% We may further integrate class incremental learning \cite{rebuffi2017icarl} approaches into our framework to accommodate incoming classes with extra data.
