\section{Conclusion}

This paper focuses on the speaker name sensitivity in close-form dialogue understanding and generation tasks. We provide a classification for previous approaches, and propose the Insensitivity Loss to further reduce the sensitivity while achieving competitive performance. Fair comparisons and comprehensive analysis are done among different approaches for the sensitivity quantitively. 
More experiments and designs targeting such dialogue fairness issues are expected in the future.
