\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The semantics of most daily dialogues are not grounded on the speakers names,
therefore changing the names consistently throughout a dialogue should not 
affect its meaning and corresponding outputs for close-form dialogue understanding and generation. 
However, pre-trained language models, which serve as
the backbone for dialogue understanding, have shown to be sensitive to 
such changes. This may result in unfairness and ethical consequences 
in real-world applications. 
No comprehensive analysis of this problem has been done in the past.
In this work, we propose a quantitative measure of model's sensitivity 
to speaker names, and comprehensively evaluate a number of known
offline and online methods for reducing speaker name sensitivity,
including a novel approach of our own. 
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets provide a benchmark for 
this problem and show the favorable performance of our approach over 
other baselines in both fairness and quality for dialogue understanding.  
%Although some work has mentioned this problem before, 
%and introduce a novel {Ins}ensitivity {Loss} to reduce the differences in attention distributions for the same utterances with different groups of names.
