\section{Conclusion}

Session-based recommendation is indispensable under the streaming-like or real-time scenario when users' historical records are unavailable. 
By leveraging the positive and negative implicit feedback from users, 
our proposed method is simple but effective to improve the trade-off between accuracy and diversity, 
as shown in experimental results. In future, we will investigate whether it is beneficial to
plug the positive/negative modules into more sophisticated session-based recommendation approaches.
