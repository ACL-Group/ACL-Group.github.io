\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce a data-driven approach for exploring the semantics of Shiba Inu vocalization and constructing a dataset including dog words and corresponding context. Compared to the former approaches, it is cost-saving and extensible for datasets. Due to the large amount of data, it provides a probability to explore new contexts and find fine-grained semantics. The approach can be transferred to other animals easily. 

We also make some preliminary observations and analyses on the dataset. The analysis shows that the different dog words are used in various contexts. Most of our findings are consistent with previous research and we also explore new semantics for words. We present the word type conveys multiple meanings and can be further divided into more fine-grained types. By given evidence, we declare the minimal semantic unit for the Shiba Inu dog language is word-related. For future work, we can further classify dog sounds into more fine-grained types because we realize a word conveys multiple meanings.
