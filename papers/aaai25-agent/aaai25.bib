    abstract = "In a depression-diagnosis-directed clinical session, doctors initiate a conversation with ample emotional support that guides the patients to expose their symptoms based on clinical diagnosis criteria. Such a dialogue system is distinguished from existing single-purpose human-machine dialog systems, as it combines task-oriented and chit-chats with uniqueness in dialogue topics and procedures. However, due to the social stigma associated with mental illness, the dialogue data related to depression consultation and diagnosis are rarely disclosed. Based on clinical depression diagnostic criteria ICD-11 and DSM-5, we designed a 3-phase procedure to construct D$^4$: a Chinese Dialogue Dataset for Depression-Diagnosis-Oriented Chat, which simulates the dialogue between doctors and patients during the diagnosis of depression, including diagnosis results and symptom summary given by professional psychiatrists for each conversation. Upon the newly-constructed dataset, four tasks mirroring the depression diagnosis process are established: response generation, topic prediction, dialog summary, and severity classification of depressive episode and suicide risk. Multi-scale evaluation results demonstrate that a more empathy-driven and diagnostic-accurate consultation dialogue system trained on our dataset can be achieved compared to rule-based bots.",

In this work, we study the problem of mixed-initiative ESC where the user and system can both take the initiative in leading the conversation. Specifically, we conduct a novel analysis on mixed-initiative ESC systems with a tailor-designed schema that divides utterances into different types with speaker roles and initiative types. Four emotional support metrics are proposed to evaluate the mixed-initiative interactions. The analysis reveals the necessity and challenges of building mixed-initiative ESC systems. In the light of this, we propose a knowledge-enhanced mixed-initiative framework (KEMI) for ESC, which retrieves actual case knowledge from a large-scale mental health knowledge graph for generating mixed-initiative responses. Experimental results on two ESC datasets show the superiority of KEMI in both content-preserving evaluation and mixed initiative related analyses.",

These agents must remember key information from an ongoing conversation to provide responses that are contextually relevant to the user. However, these agents have limited memory and can be distracted by irrelevant parts of the conversation. While many strategies exist to manage conversational memory, users currently lack affordances for viewing and controlling what the agent remembers, resulting in a poor mental model and conversational breakdowns. In this paper, we present Memory Sandbox, an interactive system and design probe that allows users to manage the conversational memory of LLM-powered agents. By treating memories as data objects that can be viewed, manipulated, recorded, summarized, and shared across conversations, Memory Sandbox provides interaction affordances for users to manage how the agent should ‘see’ the conversation.}, booktitle = {Adjunct Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology}, articleno = {97}, numpages = {3}, keywords = {Chatbots, Human-AI Interaction, Large Language Models}, location = {San Francisco, CA, USA}, series = {UIST '23 Adjunct} }
