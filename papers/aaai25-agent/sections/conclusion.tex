\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel conversational agents simulation system named \system, which is designed for depression diagnosis conversations. We construct the psychiatrist agents with tertiary memory structure, and construct supervisor plugin to perform better quality long-term depression diagnosis dialogue. Our experiments demonstrate the better performance of our \system, which could be utilized for simulating the depression diagnosis dialogue in real-life scenarios and getting the diagnosis results based on the conversation history. We conduct the experiments on the original D$^4$ history and generate simulated dialogues, both indicate the effectiveness of the memory structure and the supervisor plugin. In future work, we aim to expand the application of \system~to other domains of mental health and explore the incorporation of additional expert feedback mechanisms to further enhance its diagnostic precision. We believe \system~can be presented as an effective automation in depression diagnosis scenario.
