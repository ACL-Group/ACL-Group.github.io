\paragraph{Conversational Agent Simulation System}
Conversational agents (CAs) are agents that can interact with users through natural language~\cite{Allouch2021ConversationalAG}. With the development of large language models, more and more CAs are constructed based on LLMs~\cite{Park2023GenerativeAgents,  chen2023llmempoweredchatbotspsychiatristpatient, shao2023characterllmtrainableagentroleplaying, li2023chatdoctormedicalchatmodel, han2024ibsendirectoractoragentcollaboration, 10.1145/3586182.3615796, j√∂rke2024supportingphysicalactivitybehavior, yang2024simschatcustomisablepersonadrivenroleplaying} because of its autonomy, reactivity, pro-activeness and social ability~\cite{xi2023risepotentiallargelanguage}. Depending on whether controlling the conversation process, CAs can be divided into proactive agents~\cite{Liao2023ProactiveCA, Deng2023PromptingAE, Zhang2024AskbeforePlanPL, Deng2024TowardsHP, deng-etal-2023-knowledge} and inactive agents. In our system \system, psychiatrist agents play the role of collecting information, deciding the dialogue process, and conducting diagnosis, while patient agents need to provide information based on their profiles and the questions.

\paragraph{Mental Health Diagnosis Chatbot}
According to previous research, mental health diagnosis based on dialogue can be more favorable and effective than self-rating scales~\cite{Vaidyam2019ChatbotsAC, Abdalrazaq2019AnOO}, and a better way to elicit honest self-disclosure about personal experiences and emotions~\cite{Kawasaki2020AssessingUM, Duvvuri2022PredictingDS}. Based on whether modifying the weights of language models, the chatbot can be divided into fine-tuning method~\cite{yao-etal-2022-d4, gu2024enhancingdepressiondiagnosisorientedchatpsychological,Lan2024TowardsRA, Ren2024WundtGPTSL} and prompting method~\cite{chen2023llmempoweredchatbotspsychiatristpatient, Tao2023ClassifyingAA, Li2024LeveragingLL, Ferrario2024TheRO, Kumar2024MentalHC, Wang2023ChainofthoughtPF, seo2024diagescdialoguesynthesisintegrating}. Although the fine-tuning method has achieved high diagnosis accuracy and a standardized information-collecting process, the prompting method shows its potential to stimulate the capability of LLMs without modifying the weights, which could be costly as the scale of the language model increases.
