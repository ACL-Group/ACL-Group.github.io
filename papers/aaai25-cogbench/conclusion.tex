\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we incorporated the idea of Cookie Theft picture description task into the evaluation of the high-level cognitive abilities of LVLMs and designed a novel evaluation benchmark called CogBench.
% Images in CogBench are of high quality and require more cognitive reasonings to understand, which makes it different from existing image datasets.
The images in CogBench are of high quality and demand more complex cognitive reasoning for interpretation, setting it apart from existing image datasets.
% It consists of a image description task and a VQA task.
Experiments show that there is still a large gap between the cognitive abilities of LVLMs and human beings, indicating CogBench is a challenging benchmark.

% In the future
