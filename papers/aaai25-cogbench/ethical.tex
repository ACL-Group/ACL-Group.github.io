\section*{Ethical Statement}
\label{sec:ethical}

Most images in CogBench are manually collected from Pinterest in accordance with its terms of service.
The images are used as fair use for research purposes only, which also complies with the terms of service of Pinterest.
We will share the data with researchers who will follow the ethical considerations established in this study.
We have compensated our annotators at a rate of \$0.60 per image, which aligns with the institute's recruitment standards for labeling personnel. 
This amount is offered as an appropriate token of gratitude for their valuable time and efforts in assisting with our project.
We answer any questions our annotators have during their annotation process promptly. 
They are free to take breaks or quit the annotation task at any time.
