\KZ{Is this required for NIPS?}
% Compared to some large-scale benchmarks, CogBench is a relatively light-weight benchmark with fewer images due to our strict image collection criteria.
% We aim to substitute quantity with high-quality images and annotations containing rich semantic information.
% In the future, we will keep updating CogBench to include more high-quality images and annotations.
