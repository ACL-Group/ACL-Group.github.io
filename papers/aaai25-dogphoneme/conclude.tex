\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated an iterative method to discover an alphabet of phonemes 
as well as possible dog words with stable meanings from a corpus of dog vocalizations. This method is general and robust enough can be applied to 
other animal species. We used a vocalization dataset that comprises three
dog breeds because each single breed doesn't provide enough data to train a
solide HuBERT model or provide good statistics. In future, we seek to improve 
the data preprocessing to obtain more high-quality single breed vocalization
data. At the same time, we will work the algorithm's capability of filtering
out noise phones which are inevitable in the recordings of animals.
