\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a novel ISA task to help us find more storytelling images with rich semantics. 
We propose the first ISA dataset which consists of an Entity Complexity Scoring task and a Semantic Complexity Scoring task.
We also propose a simple yet effective method called VLISA as our baseline model for this task.
We believe this task will have a wide range of applications in the future.
For example, with the Entity Score and Semantic Score, images with different semantic complexity levels can be selected.
It can also encourage AI painting models to generate images with richer semantics.
% Experiment results demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
