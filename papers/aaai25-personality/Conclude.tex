\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we introduce PersonaMovs, an outstanding multimodal dataset tailored for personality prediction. Built upon a foundation of varied movies and TV shows, PM enriches with precise annotations for personality traits based on different psychological personality models and detailed relations networks, capturing the dynamic interplay of characters' interactions and emotional connections. By integrating multimodal data and emphasizing the fluid nature of personality within social contexts, PM opens new avenues for comprehensive analysis of personality dynamics, offering valuable insights into how personality traits manifest and interact in varied narratives.
