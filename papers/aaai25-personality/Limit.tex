\section*{Limitations}
While our PersonaMosaic designed for personality prediction shows superiority in most aspects, it also comes with inherent limitations.

Dialogues and character behaviors extracted from movies or TV shows may not always accurately reflect real-life personality traits due to the scripted nature of these interactions. Fictional characters are often designed to serve a narrative purpose, which might exaggerate or oversimplify certain personality traits for dramatic effect, leading to potential biases in personality prediction.

The process of annotating dialogues, character relationships, and personality traits, even if partially automated, involves a degree of subjectivity. Different annotators might interpret the same dialogue or behavior differently based on their own biases and experiences, leading to inconsistencies in the dataset.

The dataset may predominantly reflect the cultural norms and values of the society in which the content was produced, potentially limiting its applicability across different cultural contexts. Our dataset is based on English movies and TV shows, so it may not interpret other non-English cultural contexts properly.
