Thank you for the feedback and suggestions.

We agree with you that it will be better to extend the experiments to other platforms. However, due to time and space limitations, this paper focuses on the Weibo dataset, which is evident from the title of the paper. We are currently working on collecting more diverse data from other social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, which will be documented in future publications.

Regarding data and code, we have open-sourced them at: https://github.com/daytoylc/weibo-ice-breaking, and this will added to the paper.

The annotation workload is not large, so we hired two volunteers from our own research to evaluate the strategies used in each response. These two volunteers are graduate students, and one of them have a background in psychology. And we will add add this in the paper. 

We will revise the paper according to the other comments in the feedback.
