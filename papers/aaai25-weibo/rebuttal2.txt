Regarding the motivation of this paper, psychological research has shown that depression patients can improve anxiety, tension, stress, and various other negative emotional states by interacting with other users in online communities [1] [2]. Proactive chatbots on social media can identify users' depressive symptoms, provide timely support, and detect problems earlier than passively waiting for users to seek help, improving treatment effectiveness. Previous research on "Tree Hole Users" [3] showed that such reach-out activities on social media can alleviate the shame of seeking mental health support through anonymous and non-invasive means, meeting users' need for anonymous expression of emotions. I have included this motivation in paper section "Introduction" and will make it more obvious.

As to whether proactive intervention on social media is ultimately effective, it is something that this paper didn't seek to answer, but it will be a primary target of our research in future.
The purpose of this paper is to attempt to break the ice with depressed users through proactive communication which can help users improve their mental health.We have made some interesting findings through experiments: Depressed users are more willing to communicate with humans than with robots. The most effective interaction strategies vary depending on the type of post content, and compared to random user settings, they are more willing to interact with users who have recovered from depression. Based on these findings, we will further utilize simulated user roles recovered from depression to communicate with a large number of users in the future, in order to achieve the effect of improving depressed users' symptoms.

We will revise the paper according to other comments in the feedback.
