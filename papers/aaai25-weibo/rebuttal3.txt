Reviewer WGPC:
Thank you for your feedback and suggestions.

You are right, we utterly agree that more work on the effectiveness of chatbots. Our current paper is to simulate robots communicating with depressed patients, and to study which role the depressed users prefer to communicate with. Please note that the chatbot role in this study will declare openly that it is a bot when icebreaking with the user. （We mentioned "Role Playing" in section 4.2.1.）Once we understand which role is more preferable to the users, our future work will be to simulate that role by a chatbot under a "camouflage." 

We will revise the paper based on other detailed comments in the feedback.
