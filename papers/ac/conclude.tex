\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we present the action conceptualization problem 
which seeks to generalize the arguments (either object or subject) 
of a verb into a fixed number of concepts drawn from 
a taxonomy with limited overlap among them. 
We used a data-driven approach which extracts
such concepts by abstracting from large number of verb-argument
pairs parsed from text corpus. Our problem can be thought of as a
variant of the class-based selectional preference. The difference
is that we can control the semantic granularity of the 
generated concepts and the fact that they have limited overlaps
means that our action concepts are closers to the dictionary
``senses'' of the verb being analyzed.
We have generated an action concept lexicon for 
3734 most popular verbs in English and showed that 
such a lexicon can be useful in a variety of NLP applications.
%These concepts cover most of the valid arguments 
%in the input data and have small
%overlap with each other. We automatically generate
%such action concepts for 3734 most frequently used English verbs and
%showed that such a lexicon represent finer grained semantics of
%verbs, thus can be used in a variety of applications for
%understanding text and outperforms several well-known related approaches
%or lexicons. One possible future direction is to generate mappings
%from actions to noun concepts, such as from
%``\underline{play}/instrument'' to ``performance'' and from
%``country/\underline{invade}'' to ``war.''
