\subsection{Execution Times}
\label{sec:efficiency}
We record the running times of our branch-and-bound algorithm
for four configurations on a machine with Intel i7-4770 3.4GHz
CPU and 32GB memory, and report them in \tabref{tab:time}.
We ignore the time for sorting candidate concepts because that
is a preprocessing step whose result can be shared by all verbs.
%\GY{whose result can be reused by the verb for the next times.}
Typically the preprocessing takes just under 1 minute.
The times reported are averaged on 3 independent runs for each verb.
The table shows that our algorithm is
efficient enough to generate the action concept lexicon for most verbs.
The running times on Probase are much longer than those on WordNet,
because the concept space of Probase is much larger than WordNet
(14,262,280 concepts in Probase versus 17,157 synsets in WordNet).
