\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we build an action concept lexicon for 3734 English
verbs, evaluate its quality and show the effective of
our lexicon on several applications.
We present the datasets and preprocessing.
Then, we evaluate the accuracy and overlap of the lexicon built.
We further show the parameter tuning
and report the execution times of the AC algorithm.
After that, we evaluate the action concept's ability to
identify different senses of verbs by matching
the action concepts to WordNet synsets.
Finally, we show the effectiveness of this lexicon in
four NLP applications:
argument identification, word sense disambiguation,
action frame generation and term similarity.
