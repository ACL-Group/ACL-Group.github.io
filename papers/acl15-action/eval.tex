\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we first evaluate our algorithm by 
varying $k$ and test the overlap between concepts.
We then demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated 
action concepts by applying them to two applications: 
verb similarity and verb clustering.
%building small lexicons of
%just 20 randomly selected English verbs (our development set)
%by varying parameter $k$ and testing the quality
%of these lexicons.
%We then construct two large lexicons of 10,116 verbs using the
%parameters tuned from previous small lexicons.
%We show the key characteristics of these lexicons and the time cost
%for constructing them.
%We then demonstrate the effectiveness of these comprehensive lexicons
%by applying them to several applications: verb sense matching,
%argument identification, word sense disambiguation,
%action frame generation and term similarity.
%an action concept lexicon for 3734 English
%verbs, evaluate its quality and show the effective of
%our lexicon on several applications.
%We present the datasets and preprocessing.
%Then, we evaluate the accuracy and overlap of the lexicon built.
%We further show the parameter tuning
%and report the execution times of the AC algorithm.
%After that, we evaluate the action concept's ability to
%identify different senses of verbs by matching
%the action concepts to WordNet synsets.
