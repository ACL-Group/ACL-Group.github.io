% the paper.}
In this paper, we propose a novel configurable framework to automatically generate distractive choices for open-domain cloze-style multiple choice questions, 
which incorporates a general-purpose knowledge base to 
effectively create a small distractor candidate set, and a feature-rich learning-to-rank model to select distractors that are both plausible and reliable. Experimental results on datasets across four domains show that our framework yields 
distractors that are significantly more plausible and reliable than
previous methods. This dataset can also be used as a standard benchmark for 
distractor generation in future.
