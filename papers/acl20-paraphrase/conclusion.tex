\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for unsupervised paraphrase generation that outperforms most existing unsupervised methods, as well as supervised methods with domain adaptation. While the results are positive, there still remains many problems to be studied. Can we extract the word set with a seq2set model instead of rule-based methods? Can we find more underlying semantics? Is there a better evaluation metric than iBLEU to balance accuracy and diversity? We plan to look into these questions in the future and generate better paraphrases.
