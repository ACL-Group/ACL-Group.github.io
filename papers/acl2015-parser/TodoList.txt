related methods(especially graph-based and integrated ones) (Bean)
2. Add more analysis to related work(check paper by the 3rd reviewer) (Bean)
3. Expand the interpretation of example sentence(support imitation), add
at least one reference or evidence to this. (Yizhong)
4. Improve the result (may revise the program, remove bugs)
	* Implement do/undo transition to produce sequence (Yizhong)
	* Employ beam search and test on feature (Bean)
	* Merge vine pruning to speed up (Bean)
	* Try other training methods(average perceptron) (Low pri)
