\section{Conclusion}
We implement a novel sequence-based dependency parsing
framework which takes advantage of high order features 
in parsing history. 
%We can also adapt beam search to this framework so as to
%relax the strictly greedy nature. Vine pruning\cite{rush2012vine} could
%be incorporated to speed up the parsing.
More importantly, we discovered that the parsing accuracy is very sensitive to
the quality of parsing sequence. Future work can be focused on
developing better sequence predictors that outperform Malt action classifier.
Furthermore, we use two sets of features for sequence predictor and
head mapper right now. A unified set of features between these two components
are worth exploring.
%Besides, better sequence predicting method and unified feature
%representation of two components are worth exploring.
%
%Though we currently get a not bad result,
%the sequence predictor still needs more exploration.
%According to our experiment, slightly changes
%on the sequence can lead to a fatal decline on accuracy. Ensuring the match degree of training sequence and testing
%sequence demands a high quality of sequence predictor.
%
%Further, the features in our current implementation are not expanded and well tuned yet  and we are free to define high order features to make use of parsing history. Our framework is flexible to merge other technics to enhance the performance. Introducing beam could make up for our greedy decoder and improve our accuracy. Vine pruning\cite{rush2012vine} could speed up parsing process. Besides, better sequence predicting method and unified feature representation of two components are worth exploring.
