\section{Conclusion}

% what did we do
In summary, our work describes a knowledge based system of relation schema inferring.
By modeling selectional preference of two arguments simultaneously,
our system is able to generate human-readable type pairs for a binary relation from Open IE systems. 
% what is the result
Our experiments shows that the top ranked relation schemas for each relation reach a high precision,
which is reliable for further use.
% what's the future vision
In the future, we are going to explore researches on question answering field, leveraging these
type pair information to improve answer quality.
