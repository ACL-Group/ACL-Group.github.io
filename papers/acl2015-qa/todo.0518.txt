1. Add baseline methods and compare the result (pointed by review #2).
	a. Entity Linking Part: For one relation instance, consider all the possible 
	   <e1, e2> pairs that are 2-hop connectable, instead of producing only one best entity.
	b. Selectional Associating Part: Use the method of directly counting occurrence as the baseline.
2. Improve the program
	a. Run the system on the big ReVerb data (14728268 entity pairs)
	b. Consider removing adjectives in relation grouping step.
	c. Select top-k Freebase types which can cover almost all the Freebase entities, and perform SP only on these types.
3. Survey on other relation schema extracting approaches (other than SP), and clarify what's the advantages of SP.
4. Add more explanations about LDA based and cluster based SP, why not choose LDA based.
5. Talk more about usefulness of our system, how human efforts can be reduced in other applications (pointed by review #3).
