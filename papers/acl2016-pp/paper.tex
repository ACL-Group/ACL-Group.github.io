%1. gap between NL and KB
This paper studies the problem of discovering the
structured knowledge representation of binary 
natural language relations. The representation, known as
the schema, generalizes the traditional path of predicates to support
more complex relations,
and is inferred by a distantly supervised, data-driven approach.
%The task of paraphrasing is to translate a natural language relation into structured knowledge.
%Due to the incompleteness of a knowledge base (KB), paraphrasing is important for
%bridging semantic gaps between NL representations and canonical forms in KB.
%2. presents
%We model the semantic representation of a binary relations based on
%a small set of relation instances, and infer a set of tree structured 
%representations, called schemas.
%3. what's the schema look like (no mentioning "template" here)
% A relation schema links different predicates from KB into a tree structure, 
% and it's a compact representation and is human readable.
%4. data driven  + labeling function (measuring quality, and handle data incompleteness)
%The inference algorithm is distant supervised from automatic, data-driven 
%labels, and is capable of learning high-quality schemas that are accurate
%and general.
%optimizing both coverage on both positive and negative training data.
%5. apply to  &  competitive
% Inferred schemas of the relation can be used in downstream applications
% like knowledge base completion (KBC) and question answering (QA).
The technique can be used to enrich manually curated knowledge
base as well as support natural language question answering.
%We compare our system with state-of-the-art systems on Freebase. 
%Experiment shows
%the expressiveness of schema-based approach which improves F1 by x\% on the knowledge
%base completion task, and by y\% on question answering task.
%%6. relation similarity task (preliminary)
%We also performs a preliminary experiment on relation similarity task, and our
%system outperforms the syntactical baseline by z\%.
