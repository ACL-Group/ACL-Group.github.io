\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we attempt to imporve the performance of the relation extraction task.
Based on the joint framework of named entity recognition and relation classification,
we present a list of triple construction algorithms for effectively 
converting tagging sequences into relation triples.
We evaluate the algorithms on the popular NYT relation extraction dataset,
and the best result improves the state-of-the-art F1 by 7\%.
Experimental results show that the triple construction step is not trivial in the whole framework,
and the Distant-First algorithm is able to capture the hidden association between entity arguments of a sentence.


%In this paper, we propose 3 new triple construction algorithms to enhance
%state-of-the-art model LSTM-LSTM-Bias. Our experiments on popular NYT data 
%set shows Distance-First is the best construction algorithm. 
%Under this algorithm, 
%current state-of-the-art model gains another 14\% improvement. 
%This shows that two entities of a relation tend to be close to each other.
