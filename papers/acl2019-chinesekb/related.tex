\section{Conclusion}	
\label{sec:conclusion}	
Translation is an efficient and effective approach to alleviate the data imbalance problem for knowledge acquisition. Hopefully, these two translated datasets(\zhcon and \zhpro) we release could serve as a solid basis for Chinese NLP research. Future directions include: 1) construct other valuable Chinese resources via our approach, such as WordNet \cite{miller1998wordnet}, FrameNet \cite{Baker_98}, etc. 2) Based on \zhcon, conduct research on common sense reasoning.
