abstract = {Linking Open Data (LOD) has become one of the most im- portant community efforts to publish high-quality interconnected seman- tic data. Such data has been widely used in many applications to provide intelligent services like entity search, personalized recommendation and so on. While DBpedia, one of the LOD core data sources, contains re- sources described in multilingual versions and semantic data in English is proliferating, there is very few work on publishing Chinese semantic data. In this paper, we present Zhishi.me, the first effort to publish large scale Chinese semantic data and link them together as a Chinese LOD (CLOD). More precisely, we identify important structural features in three largest Chinese encyclopedia sites (i.e., Baidu Baike, Hudong Baike, and Chinese Wikipedia) for extraction and propose several data-level mapping strategies for automatic link discovery. As a result, the CLOD has more than 5 million distinct entities and we simply link CLOD with the existing LOD based on the multilingual characteristic of Wikipedi- a. Finally, we also introduce three Web access entries namely SPARQL endpoint, lookup interface and detailed data view, which conform to the principles of publishing data sources to LOD.},

abstract = {Knowledge is indispensable to understanding. The ongoing information explosion highlights the need to enable machines to better understand electronic text in human language. Much work has been devoted to creating universal ontologies or taxonomies for this purpose. However, none of the existing ontologies has the needed depth and breadth for “universal understanding”. In this paper, we present a universal, probabilistic taxonomy that is more comprehensive than any existing ones. It contains 2.7 million concepts harnessed automatically from a corpus of 1.68 billion web pages. Unlike traditional taxonomies that treat knowledge as black and white, it uses probabilities to model inconsistent, ambiguous and uncertain information it contains. We present details of how the taxonomy is constructed, its probabilistic modeling, and its potential applications in text understanding.},
