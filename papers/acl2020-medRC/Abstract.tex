\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework for
sentence-based relation classification.
Our model is trained not only by queries but also the support sentences.
We also present a new method for aggregating cross-domain knowledge into our model by adding open-source supplementary data.
Additionally, we construct our own dataset: the FRM dataset,
a few-shot relation classification dataset in the health domain.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art results on the proposed FRM dataset and achieves
competitive results the FewRel \citep{han-etal-2018-fewrel} dataset, especially when extremely small amount of training data is given.
