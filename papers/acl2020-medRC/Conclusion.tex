\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose MME, a few-shot learning framework for relation classification. MME aims to extract underlying information brought within support sentences. In MME, a supplementary classifier is adopted to classify the relation of each support sentence, and participates in the back propagation progress by a fast-slow learner strategy. We also propose a way of aggregating cross-domain data into the training process. This helps the model to learn underlying cross-domain knowledge. These two innovations are especially useful under circumstances where extremely few data is available.
Additionally, we construct our own dataset, the FRM dataset, a Chinese few-shot relation classification dataset in medical domain. Different from previous released few-shot relation classification datasets, the FRM dataset contains extremely limited labeled data and provides a much harder few-shot learning task. Our proposed MME framework and data augmentation method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the FRM dataset and competitive results on the FewRel dataset.
As for future work, we aim to extract abundant relations and instances from massive open-source data with our proposed MME framework to construct a knowledge base in medical domain .
