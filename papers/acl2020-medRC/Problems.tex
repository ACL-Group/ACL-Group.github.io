\section{Problems}
Our model is the best among light models.. Matching the blanks.

**Normal method 50 or 15?

CNN+proto vs CNN-ATT /PCNN-ATT ok?

Seems nowhere to mention supplementary data in related works...

Where to say our relations in dataset can be split into groups...

Task formulation: few-shot learning? meta-learning?

Eval on our dataset?

**Only adding classifier seems ...

The standard results are like x+-0.0x Ours:x

How to determine N...?

!!!!!!!renjia pao de training 20*10 wo men dagai pao bu qi lai

**When giving examples, use English or our Chinese dataset? If use others' dataset, add reference or not?
