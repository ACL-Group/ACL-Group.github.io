\section{Conclusion}

We represent a desired optimal model for $\alpha$\textit{NLG} task as an EBM 
to take the underlying goal of $\alpha$\textit{NLG} challenge as the training 
objective directly. Experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness 
and feasibility of our proposed methods. In the future, we plan to incorporate
external knowledge to obtain further improvement.
