\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we explored the ``short circuit'' phenomenon in multiple-choice natural language reasoning tasks and proposed white-box and black-box methods to detect such behavior in NLU models. By introducing crossover and mutation operations as data augmentation techniques, we effectively improved model robustness and performance on both stress and original test data, highlighting the importance of refining methodologies to enhance the reliability and robustness of natural language understanding systems.
