\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work,
we create a semi-structured sythetic dataset for opinion summarization
which suffers from the lacking of training data.
We showed that by extracting aspect-opinion pairs and implicit sentences from multiple reviews
first and then synthesizing
them into semi-structured data, we achieve
better performance on opinion summarization.
%task.
For this dataset, 
we designed an aspect guided model with opinion-aspect pair encoder and implicit sentences encoder.
The results showed that
the proposed model can make full use of semi-structured dataset
and generate high quality summaries.
