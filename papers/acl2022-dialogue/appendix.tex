The case in Table~\ref{tab:case1} is a dialogue happened between three speakers from SAMSum. 
The labeled dialogues, which are directly extracted from Multi-view's and DialoBART's released datasets are shown in Table \ref{tab:case1inputs}. ``$\mid$'' label for Multi-view refers to the topic transitions and stage transitions for the same dialogue respectively. 
We can see that topic segments by Multi-view BART are reasonable. However, such linear segmentation is not quite suitable for this dialogue since the first and third topics are the same.
``$\mid$'' in DialoBART just refers to the end of each utterance.
DialoBART failed to label any topic transitions or redundant utterances.

Compared to the reference summary, the summary generated by BART lost the information about Greg's suggestion, and DialoBART lost the information about ``medical insurance'' even though it recognized ``medical insurance'' as a keyword.
Multi-view did incorrect reasoning on who will call Linda.
Our model generated a more condensed summary covering the same key points as the reference with the original dialogue as input.

Another case from DialSumm between two speakers is in Table~\ref{tab:case3}. BART recognized ``him'' in the second utterance as ``\#Person1\#'' incorrectly. DialoBART regarded the man as ``\#Person1\#'s friends'' which isn't mentioned in the original dialogue.  Our model, DialSent-PGG generates a more accurate summary\footnote{The missing or redundancy of ``\#'' for DialSumm exists in generated summaries from all of the neural models.}.
