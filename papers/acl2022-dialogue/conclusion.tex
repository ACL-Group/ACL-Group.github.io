\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose a new approach for dialogue summarization by post-training PLMs with cross-format rephrasing ability.
The results show the advantages of our best approach, PGG with dialogue-sentence pairs, over PLMs and other state-of-the-art baselines.
Creating self-supervised tasks for cross-format post-training and incorporating compatible features for downstream fine-tuning are valuable future directions.
