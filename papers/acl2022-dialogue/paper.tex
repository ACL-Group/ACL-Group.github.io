\begin{abstract}
Previous dialogue summarization techniques adapt large language models pretrained on the narrative text by injecting dialogue-specific features into the models. These features either require additional knowledge to recognize or make the resulting models harder to tune. To bridge the format gap between dialogues and textual summaries, we propose a simple method to post-train pretrained language models (PLMs) by learning to rephrase from dialogue to narrative text. %using no additional training data. 
After that, the model is fine-tuned for dialogue summarization as usual. To this end, we provide a group of methods to construct rephrasing datasets based on the dialogue summarization data itself and newly introduce a prefix-guided generation task. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach significantly 
improves vanilla PLMs on dialogue summarization and 
outperforms other SOTA models by the summary quality and implementation costs.

%aims at generating a concise summary expressing key information for a dialogue.
%Based on the fact that language models pre-trained on narrative text corpus have achieved great success in news summarization,
%previous work focuses on accommodating these models to dialogue inputs by explicitly injecting dialogue features.
%We achieve this by automatically constructing rephrasing dataset from
%the dialogue summarization data itself and train on this data using 
%a prefix-guided generation task. %(PGG).
