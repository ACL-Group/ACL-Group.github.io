\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Existing automatic evaluation systems of chatbots mostly rely on static chat 
scripts as ground truth, which is hard to obtain, and requires access to the
models of the bots as a form of ``white-box testing''. 
Interactive evaluation mitigates this problem but requires human
involvement. In our work, we propose an interactive chatbot evaluation 
framework in which chatbots compete with each other like in 
a sports tournament, using flexible scoring metrics. 
This framework can efficiently rank chatbots independently
from their model architectures and the domains for which they are trained.
