\section{Human Evaluation}
\label{sec:humanappend}
Here we provide the table which is shown 
to the human annotators to ensure the reliability of the  annotation.
As \tabref{tab:human} shows, for each dimension, we have provided annotators
with its definition (described in \tabref{tab:methods}), 
one positive example considered as good 
behavior at this dimension,
one negative example and 
some specific tips for
evaluating these dimensions
in an interactive way.
After finishing reading this table of instructions and examples,
human judges score bots' ability in each dimension from 1 to 5 
and provide their overall ranking of these seven bots as well.
