In this section, we analyze the performance of different models in controlling length.

\end{table}

We use the example in \tabref{tab:case} to analyze different length-controllable methods since the summaries of this example generated by different models are obviously different in {\em length control} and {\em information selection}.

As shown in \tabref{tab:case}, BART itself cannot control the length of generated summaries.
So, the length of summary generated by BART is always much longer for covering more information from source document. 
After adding Exact at test time, BART can generate summary with length exactly the same as desired length. But, as a {\em early-stop during decoding methods}, Exact always produce incomplete summaries. The summary with $30$ tokens of Exact repeats its summary with $10$ tokens during generation. Because such methods ignore that the summaries with different lengths of one document should represent different information of source document. 
BLPAS tends to select more information with length constraints, which may generate summaries with length longer than desired length (the red part in \tabref{tab:case}). 
The lengths of summaries generated by LAAM and PtLAAM in \tabref{tab:case} are the same as the desired lengths. 

Compared with PtLAAM, given the desired length as $10$, LAAM loses the important information about the reason why Paul was charged as there are few training pairs with summary lengths as $10$. PtLAAM pretrained on LBD can select information according to various desired length as the summary lengths in LBD are evenly distributed in different length ranges. The summaries with desired length as $30$ of LAAM and PtLAAM are more similar than their summaries with desired length as $10$. 
This is because that there are many more summaries with length about $30$ than those with length about $10$ in original dataset. Thus, PtLAAM is more effective in generating summaries of lengths that do not appear in the original datasets.
