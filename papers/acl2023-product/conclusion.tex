\section{Conclusion}
% In this work, we address the challenges of $\mathbf{$\mathbf{DMPC}$}$ for giant e-commerce platforms. 
To tackle $\mathbf{DMPC}$ problem,
% with domain-specific taxonomy classification tasks, 
we propose a unified $\mathsf{TaLR}$ framework with two plug-in modules empowered with cross-domain meta concepts.
With comprehensive experiments on real-world $\mathbf{DMPC}$ datasets, results under both multi-domain and taxonomy evolving conditions exhibit the transferability and maintenance efficiency of $\mathsf{TaLR}$.
% \TODO{a bit weak

% For future works, we will deploy this system in product environment to test its online performance. To assure robustness, We shall also investigate contrastive learning modifications to alleviate the performance drop when node $divide$ happens. 
% We may further integrate class incremental learning \cite{rebuffi2017icarl} approaches into our framework to accommodate incoming classes with extra data.
