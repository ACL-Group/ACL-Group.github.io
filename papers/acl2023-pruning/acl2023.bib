    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

Our first of three submissions is based on Language Agnostic Delexicalisation, a novel delexicalisation method that match values in the input to their occurrences in the corresponding text through comparison of pretrained multilingual embeddings, and employs a character-level post-editing model to inflect words in their correct form during relexicalisation. Our second submission forfeits delexicalisation and uses SentencePiece subwords as basic units. Our third submission combines the previous two by alternating between the output of the delexicalisation-based system when the input contains unseen entities and/or properties and the output of the SentencePiece-based system when the input is seen during training.",

We propose a two-stage model-compression method to reduce a model{'}s inference time cost. We first decompose the matrices in the model into smaller matrices and then perform feature distillation on the internal representation to recover from the decomposition. This approach has the benefit of reducing the number of parameters while preserving much of the information within the model. We experimented on BERT-base model with the GLUE benchmark dataset and show that we can reduce the number of parameters by a factor of 0.4x, and increase inference speed by a factor of 1.45x, while maintaining a minimal loss in metric performance.",

In this paper, we study such a collection of tickets, which is referred to as {''}winning tickets{''}, in extremely over-parametrized models, e.g., pre-trained language models. We observe that at certain compression ratios, the generalization performance of the winning tickets can not only match but also exceed that of the full model. In particular, we observe a phase transition phenomenon: As the compression ratio increases, generalization performance of the winning tickets first improves then deteriorates after a certain threshold. We refer to the tickets on the threshold as {''}super tickets{''}. We further show that the phase transition is task and model dependent {---} as the model size becomes larger and the training data set becomes smaller, the transition becomes more pronounced. Our experiments on the GLUE benchmark show that the super tickets improve single task fine-tuning by 0.9 points on BERT-base and 1.0 points on BERT-large, in terms of task-average score. We also demonstrate that adaptively sharing the super tickets across tasks benefits multi-task learning.",

The main virtue of this representation is its sensitivity to the structure of the model, which can translate into exponential time savings for search algorithms. In this paper we introduce an AND/OR search algorithm that explores a context-minimal AND/OR search graph in a best-first manner for solving 0/1 Integer Linear Programs (0/1 ILP). We also extend to the 0/1 ILP domain the depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search with caching algorithm which was recently proposed by [1] for solving optimization tasks in graphical models. The effectiveness of the best-first AND/OR search approach compared to depth-first AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search is demonstrated on a variety of benchmarks for 0/1 ILPs, including instances from the MIPLIB library, real-world combinatorial auctions, random uncapacitated warehouse location problems and MAX-SAT instances.",

    abstract = "Although pretrained language models can be fine-tuned to produce state-of-the-art results for a very wide range of language understanding tasks, the dynamics of this process are not well understood, especially in the low data regime. Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms (e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions of parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples? In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of intrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to explain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained models have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to achieve 90{\%} of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low dimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to provide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of the full parameter count.",
