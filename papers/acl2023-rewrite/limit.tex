\section{Limitations}

Our framework is a two-phase process, which has its inherent defects, that is, the results of the second phase depend on the results of the phase 1. Because the sequence annotation algorithm in the first phase cannot achieve 100\% accuracy, it will predict the wrong position that should be rewritten when the second phase is followed, which will further lead to the error of the final result.

On the other hand, T5 model is only used to predict the words that should be filled in blank, rather than generate the whole sentence, which may lead to the decline of the overall fluency of the sentence.
