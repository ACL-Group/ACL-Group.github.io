\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
%In recent years, the task of rewriting incomplete utterances in multi-turn dialogues has received unanimous attention. %The expanded utterances have more sufficient information, which is conducive to the downstream response generation, intention extraction and other work.
%Most of the existing works directly generate rewritten utterances by sequence to sequence method, ignoring the structural constraints in the sentence, that is, the rewritten part can only be added to limited positions. 
Rewriting incomplete and ambiguous utterances can improve dialogue models' understanding of
the context and help them generate better results.
However, the existing end-to-end models will have the problem of too large search space, resulting in poor quality of rewriting results.
We propose a 2-phase rewriting framework which first predicts the empty slots in the utterance that need to
be completed, and then generate the part to be filled into each positions. Our framework is 
simple to implement, fast to run, and achieves the state-of-the-art results on several public rewriting datasets.
