Response to Review #1:

Thank you for taking the time to review.
You mentioned the rule based approach (section 2.1.1), which is just a baseline for our approach, not our main method. For our main approach, please see section 2.1.2. As stated in Section 6, there is error propagation in a two-phase method, which cannot be avoided because the accuracy of the first step cannot reach 100%. But in terms of the end-to-end results, our approach demonstrates 
significant advantages over a series of baselines (Section 3), which shows that a two-phase approach does have its merits.

Response to Review #2:

Thank you for taking the time to review.
Q1. In the context of ChatGPT, it is doubted that if the rewriting of incomplete utterances is a valid problem or not. It is not convincing if rewriting is a valid problem to solve.
Dialogue systems are useful in many tasks and scenarios. Rewriting utterances is particularly useful when a light-weight dialogue model which only takes the last utterance as input is desirable (please see lines 042-044). This is exactly where very large models such as ChatGPT cannot help, not to mention the various woes of current ChatGPT such as the cost of deployment, slow inference speed, and privacy issues. Therefore, we believe that it is not fair to compare ChatGPT with the kind of rewriting technology that we are advocating in this paper, and the latter still has its merits. 

Q2. Rewriting those utterances using T5 or BART cannot guarantee not to distort the original utterance.
Using T5 and BART in an end-to-end, one-phase fashion, can indeed lead to changes in meaning of the original sentence. These are in fact the baselines in this paper. Our 2-phase approach, which keeps the overall structure of the original utterance and rewrites only local slots, is designed to tackle this exact problem.

Q3. They did not compare with ChatGPT or GPT-3 in the experiments.
The scale of ChatGPT or GPT-3 is at least 3 orders of magnitude larger than 
the models we use in this paper, which means this is not a fair comparison. Nevertheless, we still conducted the following supplementary experiments on ChatGPT.

*** Begin of Prompt:

Please complete the following incomplete sentence completion task. Given the context of the conversation and incomplete sentences to be rewritten, you need to complete the sentences to be rewritten so that they can be understood out of context. Please do not change the words in the sentence to be rewritten or the structure of the sentence unless necessary. Do not use information that goes beyond the context. Your answer should be at most 10 words more than the sentence to be rewritten.

give an example:

context:
anna politkovskaya
the murder remains unsolved , 2016

sentence to be rewritten:
did they have any clues ?

answer:
did investigators have any clues in the unresolved murder of anna politkovskaya ?

If you understand, I will give you some tasks.

*** End of Prompt
...


Some example outputs:
Ours: did fsb get into trouble for the attack against the account annapolitovskaya@us provider1 ?
ChatGPT: Did the perpetrators face consequences for the attack on Anna Politkovskaya's email?

Ours: why did superstar billy graham return to the wwwf ?
ChatGPT: What was the reason for Superstar Billy Graham's return to WWWF?

Table 1: Experimental results on 30 cases of CANARD.
Methods: F1 / F2 / B1 / B2 / R1 / R2 / RL
Ours: 46.6 / 33.3 / 63.5 / 53.9 / 67.6 / 49.4 / 64.2
ChatGPT: 41.8 / 23.4 / 45.0 / 30.1 / 23.7 / 52.2 / 23.3 / 46.3

After repeated tries and with the best prompt we can find, ChatGPT is still worse than our method in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. However, by human evaluation, testers think that the rewriting results of ChatGPT are of higher quality (more fluent). This is no surprise given the tremendous parameter space of ChatGPT.

Response to Review #3:

Thank you for taking the time to review. We will modify the paper per your suggestions.

As stated in Section 1, our main contribution is the 2-phase framework. Reducing semantic distortion from direct generation of rewriting through pre-locating the sites of rewriting is its novelty. The work in the missing reference is not a 2-phase method. The authors only use the T5 and Pegasus as the rewriting model directly. Using T5 directly is only one of our baselines. To the best of our knowledge, there were no previous work on dialogue rewriting that uses a similar 2-phase approach like ours. Please enlighten us by giving specific references.
 
Question A: there are no errors in line 295, and BART-base is mentioned in line 300.

General Response to Reviewers:

Response to Chairs:

R1: B, H

R1 states "The rule-based method in the first phase takes risks of affecting the understanding task if there are mistakes or missing rules in the step as mentioned in the paper", which we believe corresponds to the review issue type B, H. It is unreasonable in this case because the rule-based method is not our main approach. And R1's comment is too short and lacks information.

R2: A, H

R2 states "In the context of ChatGPT, it is doubted that if the rewriting of incomplete utterances is a valid problem or not.", which we believe corresponds to the review issue type A, H. It is unreasonable in this case because they did not give any reasons for this rather arbitrary speculation, and used it to discredit our work. R2's comment is also too short and lacks information.

R3: A, H

R3 states that our approach has been attempted previously without any specific evidences. The only missing reference provided by R3 has nothing to do with his allegation. R3's comment is too short and lacks information.

Please consider the above situation and assign this paper to some other reviewers if possible.
