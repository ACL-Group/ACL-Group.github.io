\begin{abstract}
How animals communicate and whether they have languages is a persistent
curiosity of human beings. However, the study of animal communications
has been largely restricted to data from field recordings or in a controlled
environment, which is expensive and limited in scale and variety. %thus statistically insignificance. 
%People hold intense interest to learn what animals are expressing for 
%research, related applications, or sometimes just curiosity. 
In this paper, we take domestic Shiba Inu dogs as an example and
extract their vocal communications from a large amount of
YouTube videos of Shiba Inu dogs. We classify these clips into different scenarios and locations, and further transcribe
the audio into phonetically symbolic scripts through a systematic
process. We discover consistent phonetic symbols among their expressions, which indicates that Shiba Inu dogs can have systematic verbal communication patterns. This reusable framework produces the first-of-its-kind Shiba Inu
vocal communication dataset that will be valuable to future research
in both zoology and linguistics. 
%\MY{Add ``Consistent phonetic symbols are discovered from these dogs indicating that they have systematic verbal communication patterns''?}
 
%For dogs, which are one of the most common animals around humans, many researchers have tried to know their meanings of voice. However, these previous researches most took dogs’ voice as an entirety and ignored the internal patterns. At the same time, these datasets used were in limited scenes and sizes which lacked universality. In this paper, we have gained phoneme-grid Shiba Inu dogs audios from open public media through a reusable systematic process and assigned phoneme labels like International Phonetic Alphabet through clustering. Finally, a large-size audios with transcripts dataset of Shiba Inu dogs is constructed, which will facilitate further research in this area.

% \section{Introduction}

% These instructions are for authors submitting papers to ACL 2023 using \LaTeX. They are not self-contained.

% % \section{Document Body}

% % \subsection{Footnotes}

% % Footnotes are inserted with the \verb|\footnote| command.\footnote{This is a footnote.}

% % \subsection{Tables and figures}

% % See Table~\ref{tab:accents} for an example of a table and its caption.
% % \textbf{Do not override the default caption sizes.}

% % \subsection{Hyperlinks}

% % Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
% % \begin{quote}
% % \tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
% % \end{quote}
% % This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.

% % \subsection{Citations}



% % Table~\ref{citation-guide} shows the syntax supported by the style files.
% % We encourage you to use the natbib styles.
% % You can use the command \verb|\citet| (cite in text) to get ``author (year)'' citations, like this citation to a paper by \citet{Gusfield:97}.
% % You can use the command \verb|\citep| (cite in parentheses) to get ``(author, year)'' citations \citep{Gusfield:97}.
% % You can use the command \verb|\citealp| (alternative cite without parentheses) to get ``author, year'' citations, which is useful for using citations within parentheses (e.g. \citealp{Gusfield:97}).

% % \subsection{References}

% % \nocite{Ando2005,augenstein-etal-2016-stance,andrew2007scalable,rasooli-tetrault-2015,goodman-etal-2016-noise,harper-2014-learning}

% % The \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} style files provided roughly follow the American Psychological Association format.
% % If your own bib file is named \texttt{custom.bib}, then placing the following before any appendices in your \LaTeX{} file will generate the references section for you:
% % \begin{quote}
% % \begin{verbatim}
% % \bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
% % \bibliography{custom}
% % \end{verbatim}
% % \end{quote}
% % You can obtain the complete ACL Anthology as a Bib\TeX{} file from \url{https://aclweb.org/anthology/anthology.bib.gz}.
% % To include both the Anthology and your own .bib file, use the following instead of the above.
% % \begin{quote}
% % \begin{verbatim}
% % \bibliographystyle{acl_natbib}
% % \bibliography{anthology,custom}
% % \end{verbatim}
% % \end{quote}
% % Please see Section~\ref{sec:bibtex} for information on preparing Bib\TeX{} files.

% % \subsection{Appendices}

% % Use \verb|\appendix| before any appendix section to switch the section numbering over to letters. See Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix} for an example.

% \section{Bib\TeX{} Files}
% \label{sec:bibtex}

% Unicode cannot be used in Bib\TeX{} entries, and some ways of typing special characters can disrupt Bib\TeX's alphabetization. The recommended way of typing special characters is shown in Table~\ref{tab:accents}.

% Please ensure that Bib\TeX{} records contain DOIs or URLs when possible, and for all the ACL materials that you reference.
% Use the \verb|doi| field for DOIs and the \verb|url| field for URLs.
% If a Bib\TeX{} entry has a URL or DOI field, the paper title in the references section will appear as a hyperlink to the paper, using the hyperref \LaTeX{} package.

\section*{Limitations}
% 数据集 录音设备影响、噪声存在导致较大浪费
\textbf{Dataset Noise}~\quad As the audios are obtained from the videos on YouTube, the quality of the videos will have an impact on the quality of the final transcript. For example, inferior recording equipment may affect the quality of the sound, although we have done noise removal to keep the quality, the presence of background noise will cause some losses in the transcribing process.

% 与场景结合
\noindent \textbf{Relationship Between Transcripts and Scenes}\quad In this work we get the transcript of Shiba Inu dogs, and we also find that the dataset covers a variety of activities and scenes. There may be an interesting relationship between the dog vocal units and the environment including the scene and activity. However, we did not quantitatively analyze 
 the relationship. Considerably more work will need to be done to discover semantic information in dog barks.

\noindent \textbf{Phoneme Labeling Accuracy}~\quad In \secref{sec:clustering} we cluster the syllables and assign phonetic symbols to them. Then in \secref{sec:phone_eva} we evaluate the result by MOS. It can be seen in \figref{fig:phoneticaccuracy} that the accuracy score is not very high, which can be improved in our future work.

% ACL 2023 requires all submissions to have a section titled ``Limitations'', for discussing the limitations of the paper as a complement to the discussion of strengths in the main text. This section should occur after the conclusion, but before the references. It will not count towards the page limit.
% The discussion of limitations is mandatory. Papers without a limitation section will be desk-rejected without review.

% While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. 
% Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative.
% In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire crucial further investigation are welcome.

\section*{Ethics Statement}
This paper makes use of only open-source video data from YouTube. During the transcribing we only focus on the dog barkings, make no use of the personal information of the users, so the released dataset ShibaScript does not contain any personal information, hence doesn’t breach the privacy of any persons.
