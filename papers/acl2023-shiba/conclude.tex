\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}  
In this work, we introduce an unprecedented approach for transcribing vocal communications of Shiba Inu dogs and release a corresponding dataset ShibaScript. Compared to the former approaches, it can save a lot of cost and make the dataset extensible. The approach can be transferred to other animals easily. And most importantly, the method is the first-step into investigating the vocal patterns of dogs, bringing inspiration to the field of animal understanding. 

We also make some preliminary statistical evaluation and analysis on ShibaScript. The evaluation shows that our symbol assignments in those transcripts are consistent. In the analysis part, we have shown some interesting findings related to the lexical distribution. For future work, we can further research the semantic meanings of dog vocal expressions because we have obtained the corresponding videos of dog vocal expressions. 
% \MY{This conclusion is too weak. You can remind yourself of the contribution bullet points and add a few sentences to highlight the nice part of ShibaScript, and what kind of future work can be done to explore animal language, and what's our work's standing towards this ambitious goal}
