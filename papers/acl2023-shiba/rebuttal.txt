Reviewer1.
Concern on research subject: 

We sincerely appreciate your comments. However we disagree that any animal-related work is outside the scope of ACL,  which communicates scientific results on computational linguistics and natural language processing. Animal languages, or communications between dogs in this paper, are clearly legitimate forms of **natural languages**. There are two things we want to clarify: 

1. Our ultimate goal is to understand the verbal expressions of dogs, the prerequisite of which is audio preprocessing, similar to any other existing spoken language understanding. For the record, ACL has recently accepted speech-related papers such as ASR or TTS (see refs below).

2. Although there's an on-going debate about whether animal communications are a language, nothing is conclusive at this point. Nonetheless, our work of identifying the unique acoustic symbols and further transcribing the dog barks into written text is an important first step toward the systematic understanding of dog communications. This could open up a brand new chapter in natural language processing research.

Reviewer2.
Concern on semantics:

Thanks for your comment. There is a **major misunderstanding about the goal of this paper**, which is to transcribe dog barks into a sequence of written symbols. While it is our long-term goal to study also the syntax and semantics of the dog language, we limit the scope of this paper to the purely lexical analysis of dog communication.  In the conclusion section, we have stated that we plan to explore the associations between semantics and symbols in our future work.

Reviewer3.
Concern on evaluation: 

We owe you a sincere apology for the confusion about some experimental setup. In fact, we had three individuals evaluate the accuracy of our syllables and words. We consider a transcribed sample to be correct if MOS>= 4 and incorrect otherwise. Consequently, the inter-annotator agreement by Fleiss Kappa are respectively 0.609 and 0.516. We will follow your detailed advice to polish the paper.

Concern on more sentences:

We would like to stress that the framework and the pipeline for transcribing dog communications into phonetic symbols is the main contribution of this paper. The dataset is a contribution to a lesser extent. Even though at the time of submission, the dataset included only the data of 16 dogs, this dataset is growing constantly, as we download more Shiba Inu videos and process them. We will release a substantially bigger dataset when this paper is accepted. 

Concern on clustering input:

During clustering, we used the filterbank features of syllables, which was briefly mentioned in Section 2.6. We are sorry about this confusion, and we will make the necessary revisions.


Response to Chairs
R1: B

R1 states that he rejects us because our paper is beyond the scope of ACL, which is a heuristic and a stereotype that rejects any non-human-language work out right. This is preposterous because dog language is clearly also natural language, and the study of dog language is clearly linguistics as well. In fact, we believe our study on animal communications will breathe new life into the ACL community, and such novel problems and ideas should be cherished and not extinguished. 


R2: G

R2 states that his main reason for rejecting this work is that the paper didn't study the semantics of dog barks. But we have never claimed that semantics is a goal of this work, except for an overview picture in Fig 1, which shows the long-term vision of this research. As we stated clearly in the introduction (and our titile), the focus of this paper is the framework of transcribing dog barks into a sequence of symbols, which can be thought of as the lexical analysis of the dog language.
