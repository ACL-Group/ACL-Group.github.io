Review #1
What is this paper about and what contributions does it make?
The study presents a dataset of transcribed barks of Shiba Inu, a dog breed popular in Internet cultures. The dataset is constructed on a base of YouTube videos, specifically mined for this study - each audio sample is split into sentence-like and word-like smaller samples (determined by the granularity of barking), and the "words" are mapped to 10 syllables of Shiba Inu "phonetic alphabet", empirically identified in the study. This automatically generated transcription was further verified by a human expert. Authors additionally annotate the dataset with various extra-linguistic features, i.e. type of dog activity on the video.
Reasons to accept
The paper is well-written and easy to read and presents an interesting approach for annotating audio data containing animal sounds in a linguistics-like manner (as authors claim, "the framework is the first to assign phonetic symbols on dog barks as well as describe dogs' vocal communication in a formal way").
Reasons to reject
The research subject is my main concern - even though the authors use certain computational linguistics methods for dataset processing and analysis, seemingly the focus of the study was more related to computational audio processing methods rather than language-related studies (as the link between dogs' communication and language is clearly controversial). And while I appreciated the authors' creative effort in coming up with the "meme dogs" study, it nevertheless feels like the paper could be a better fit for a zoological or SIGBOVIK-like conference.

Review #2
What is this paper about and what contributions does it make?
The paper provides a dataset of utterances produced by dogs. The dataset contains audio extracted from YouTube with manual phonetic labels.
Reasons to accept
This paper covers on a topic not often tackled in the ACL literature - animal communication.m It may spark ideas on the nature of non-human communication and the meaning of "low resource languages".
The paper is well scoped - it focuses on a particular breed of dog (shiba inu) and presents a straightforward approach and analysis. The analysis was easy to follow with clear diagrams and common terminology borrowed from the study of human language (e.g. "sentences", "words", "phonemes").
Reasons to reject
The authors do not make a convincing case that the specific topic covered and the dataset provided are of interest to the ACL community. The analysis presented seems mostly reasonable, but also rather repetitive - I think this would have made a stronger short paper or a simple blog post.
The authors describe the potential for treating canine communication as language in the introduction and note several weaknesses with prior works, but don't meaningfully engage with the vast majority of those ideas in the body of the paper.
For example, they claim to tackle semantics, but the only mention of semantics is in 4.1, "Among these bigrams [of shina inu noises], sevearl appear extremely frequently. It shows a possibility that they are associated with some common semantic meanings." That's it. That's not actually grappling with semantics.
It's not surprising that dogs make different noises in different situations, and quantifying those differences is a nice exercise, but I don't think the level of scientific value here rises to the level of this conference.
Typos, Grammar, Style, and Presentation Improvements
The work uses several terms that are not defined, and yet are important to the provided justification. For example, the introduction mentions "structural languages" (line 051) - but what is that? Also what are "linguistic patterns" (052) and "languages" (064)? It is okay not to have crisp definitions of all of these items, but then they should not be used to justify the paper.
Some awkward turns of phrase include "lie in three aspects" (line 100), "what we care and label transcripts for" (167), "we have the minimum unit as a phoneme that can construct syllables and words, based on which we form sentences with grammatical rules" (251-254), "what we concern more" (305).
Finally, there are no pictures of dogs in this paper! The very small illustration of a dog on page 1 fell drastically short of my visual expectations.

Review #3
What is this paper about and what contributions does it make?
The main goal of the paper is to study communication between animals. This first version of the pipeline studies the communication of Shiba Inu dogs. Using YouTube recordings of Shiba Inu dogs as the input source, the authors have been able to extract their communication and save it in the form of transcription. Peper introduces a novel pipeline that is able to process videos and transform them into a vocal communication dataset of Shiba Inu dogs called ShibaScript. The significant advantage of the pipeline is the ease of adaptation for other animals. This dataset, along with the preliminary statistical evaluation are the paper's main contributions.
Reasons to accept
•	the adaptation of the pipeline to different animals
•	transcription system of dog communication into syllables
•	developed dataset
•	coverage of a variety of scenes and activities of Shiba Inu dogs
Reasons to reject
Large portion of the success of the paper depends on the accuracy of the phoneme estimation, which is -- as the authors themselves affirm in the Limitations section -- not very high. Most worrying for me though is the "find a person" -- does that mean it was all evaluated just by a single person? If not, what was the inter-annotator agreement?
Questions for the Author(s)
Question A: Is there a reason why the resulting dataset does not include more sentences? If I understand it correctly, there is no manual annotation in the dataset, so transcribing more videos into the final dataset shouldn't be a problem.

I would appreciate some examples that point out differences from the proposed dataset.
Typos, Grammar, Style, and Presentation Improvements
Grammatical errors:
•	for satisfying "the" our curiosity
•	as all "the" sounds
Line 180: remove full stop
Paper organization: Related works should be at the beginning of the paper.
Also -- it is not clear what exactly was the input to the syllables clustering, and that should by all means be clarified
