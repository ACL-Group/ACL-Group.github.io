\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
%The semantics of most dialogues are not grounded on the speakers names,
%therefore 
%close-form dialogue generation. 
Changing speaker names consistently throughout a dialogue should not 
affect its meaning and corresponding outputs for text generation from dialogues. 
However, pre-trained language models, serving as
the backbone for dialogue-processing tasks, have shown to be sensitive to 
nuances. This may result in unfairness
in real-world applications. 
No comprehensive analysis of this problem has been done in the past.
In this work, we propose to quantitatively measure a model's sensitivity 
on speaker names, and comprehensively evaluate a number of known methods for reducing speaker name sensitivity,
including a novel approach of our own. 
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets provide a benchmark for 
this problem and show the favorable performance of our approach in 
sensitivity reduction and quality of generation.
