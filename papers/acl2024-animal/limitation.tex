\section*{Limitation}

The discovery of dog sound units heavily relies on the quality of the dataset. 
Even though we have implemented multiple measures to enhance the dataset's quality, noise may still be present due to various factors, including the recording equipment, background noise, or added noise by video uploaders. 
Further research may focus on finetune PANNs or other sound event detection models to acquire datasets of higher quality.
