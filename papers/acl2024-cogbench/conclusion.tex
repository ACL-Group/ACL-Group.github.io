\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we incorporated the idea of Cookie Theft picture description task into the evaluation of the high-level cognitive abilities of LVLMs and designed a novel evaluation benchmark called CogBench.
Images in CogBench are of high quality and contain rich cognitive reasoning, which makes it different from existing image datasets.
% It consists of a image description task and a VQA task.
Experiments show that there is still a large gap between the cognitive ability of LVLMs and human beings, indicating CogBench is a challenging benchmark.
% \KZ{My overall impression is that this paper is substantially inflated to 
% 8 pages. There's too much fluffs here and there. Based on the contributions
% outlines and amount of meat we have, we should cut it to a 4-page short
% paper.}
% In the future
