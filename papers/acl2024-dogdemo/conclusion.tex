\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces a canine language lexical analysis system  where users or researchers can upload their own recorded canine videos or audios, interactively observe, listen to, and compare their transcription results. Additionally, they can use the Phoneme or Vocabulary modules to compare example video or audio scenes with the uploaded ones, thereby making significant contributions to verifying the structure of canine language and further understanding canine communication.

We also manually assessed the consistency of phoneme labels and the accuracy of parsing, corroborating the reliability of words through pauses duration. 
For future research, researchers can utilize this interactive system to explore the correlation between video context and canine vocalizations, discovering commonalities in canine vocal vocabulary meanings from a larger pool of videos, thereby laying a solid foundation for a deeper understanding of canine vocalizations.
