\begin{abstract}
  Large language Models~(LLMs) are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy in resource-constrained environments due to their excessive memory and computational demands. In addition to model parameters, the key-value cache is also stored in GPU memory, growing linearly with batch size and sequence length. As a remedy, recent works have proposed various eviction policies for maintaining the overhead of key-value cache under a given budget. 
 This paper embarks on the efficacy of existing eviction policies in terms of \textit{importance score calculation} and \textit{eviction scope construction}. We identify the deficiency of prior policies in these two aspects and introduce RoCo, a \underline{r}\underline{o}bust \underline{c}ache \underline{o}mission policy based on local attention scores and robustness measures. Extensive experimentation spanning prefilling and auto-regressive decoding stages validates the superiority of RoCo. Finally, we release EasyKV, a versatile software package dedicated to user-friendly key-value constrained generative inference. Code available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EasyKV-9088/}.
