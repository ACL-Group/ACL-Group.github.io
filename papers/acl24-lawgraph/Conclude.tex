\section{Conclusion}

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Prison Term Prediction (PTP) and identified two major issues: structural representation of legal knowledge and the scarcity of training data for most crimes. To address these issues, we proposed a novel approach, \lawgraph{}, to represent the structural legal knowledge. We further proposed a lightweight Statute Knowledge Encoder (SKE) for end-to-end training of our model. We performed extensive experiments to compare SKE with previous works and LLMs. The experimental results have indicated the superiority of SKE over previous works.
