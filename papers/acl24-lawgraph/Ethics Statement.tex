\section*{Ethic Statement}
The cases analyzed in this paper are sourced from the open dataset CAIL2018, which has been widely utilized in prior research. Given that these cases are published on China Judgment Online and have been anonymized, the risk of disclosing personal information about the individuals involved is minimal. Nonetheless, to enhance privacy protection and adhere to ethical standards, we will only release the case indices, not the full text of the cases.
