\section*{Limitations}
We introduced a new method to transform plain text statute information into law graphs, aiming to enhance the performance of predictors in predicting prison terms. Our research demonstrated that our proposed construction process can produce law graphs with an average accuracy of 97\%. However, we observed that errors in the law graph can impact the performance of the predictor, while the rate of error is small.
Furthermore, the potential of our law graph to improve performance in other legal tasks and in cases involving multiple crimes has not been thoroughly investigated. These two aspects will be the primary focus of our future research.
