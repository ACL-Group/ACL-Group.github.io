\begin{abstract}
In the realm of mental health support chatbots, it is vital to show empathy and encourage self-exploration to provide tailored solutions. However, current approaches tend to provide general insights or solutions without fully understanding the help-seeker's situation. Therefore, we propose \textit{PsyMix}, a chatbot that integrates the analyses of the seeker's state from the perspective of a psychotherapy approach (Chain-of-Psychotherapies, \textit{CoP}) before generating the response, and learns to incorporate the strength of various psychotherapies by finetuning on a mixture of CoPs. Through comprehensive evaluation, we found that \textit{PsyMix} can outperform the ChatGPT baseline, and demonstrate a comparable level of empathy in its responses to that of human counselors.
% \MY{Why we are not saying mixed/mixture CoT? SupportChat reads ambiguous and the comparison is not straightforward}
% \KZ{I doubt there is such as thing as psychotherapy analysis. It's either psychoanalytical therapy or psychoanalysis. We need to get the terminology right.}
