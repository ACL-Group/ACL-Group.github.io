\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we introduce \textit{PsyMix} to address the issue of ``superficial empathy'' and ``quick-fix solution'' of common counselling chatbots. The analysis of the seekerâ€™s situation from various psychotherapy approaches (\textit{CoP}) are generated with the guideline from expert psychotherapist and further mixed for the finetuning of LLM. Human evaluations demonstrate that CoP-guided model surpasses ChatGPT baseline, and \textit{PsyMix} further improves upon any single CoP. Notably, \textit{PsyMix} delivers more specific and contextually relevant responses, with its empathy level closely matching human responses.
