\section*{Ethical Considerations}
The dataset we use is from the study introduced by \citet{{li-etal-2023-understanding}}, which is granted ethics approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (20211013LZZ001). We obtain the dataset through proper channels and ensure its use solely for this project's research. Bulk in-depth analysis of the dataset in this study is conducted by LLM and does not involve human annotators.

During manual evaluations, we fully consider diversity, with evaluators coming from different genders, ages, educational, and occupational backgrounds. They understand the significance of this study and willingly undertake unpaid evaluation work. We ensure that evaluators are mentally and physically healthy adults, and conduct follow-ups after evaluations to ensure they are not adversely affected by reading conversations with negative emotions.
