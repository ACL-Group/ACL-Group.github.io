\section*{Limitations}

In our study, there are some limitations that could be addressed in future research.
\begin{enumerate}
\item We currently only incorporate three mainstream psychotherapy approaches (i.e., PCT, CBT, SFBT) into Chain-of-Psychotherapies in this work, future explorations can include a wider range of psychotherapies like psychodynamics~\cite{Sheppard2006psychodynamics} to evaluate whether the more mixture, the better performance a chatbot will have.
\item  Despite our best efforts in designing the prompt for empathy analysis, the scores produced by GPT-4 are not highly accurate. Although GPT-4 is the most commonly employed model for assessing the generation effectiveness of LLMs~\cite{liu-etal-2023-g}, it tends to favor sentences generated by models like ChatGPT as higher quality, often deeming human responses as lower quality due to perceived inferior coherence compared to model-generated responses. Hence, it is imperative for us to explore more effective automated evaluation methods in the future.
