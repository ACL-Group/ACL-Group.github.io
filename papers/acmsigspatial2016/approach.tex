\section{Our Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

Our traffic prediction approach involves 3 major stages: i) integrating
the map and live traffic data from Baidu Map into OSM; ii) feature engineering;
and iii) prediction model training. In the rest of this section, we will first
give some preliminaries about OSM and Baidu Map and then present these three
stages in more detail. We showcase a system demo at the end of this section.
