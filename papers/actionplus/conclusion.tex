\section{Conclusion}
We presented a conditional semantic search engine
featured for action searching. This search engine
is able to use the Action-Noun mapping we generated
offline, to extract more relevant webpages which 
otherwise might be neglected by keyword search. 
Evaluation results show that our method performs
better than the original Lucene index search
algorithm in action concept searching. We hope to 
extend this search engine in the future
so that it can search not only online news,
but also generic websites.
