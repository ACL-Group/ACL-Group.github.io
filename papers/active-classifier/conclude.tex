\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we take a step towards the practical utilization of theoretical 
AL strategies. We experiment AL strategies on various classifiers common in many-class short text classification 
and on multiple many-class datasets including Chinese and English. We conclude the significance AL strategies on practical scenarios and that fastText is the deep classifier best suitable for AL.
Our work also shows that there is no best general solution suitable for all datasets and no clear correlation can be extracted between the performance of AL as well as the dataset characteristics.
% A possible avenue for future work is to consider a more general problem setting 
% and come up with an approach which will generate consistent results on 
% both few-class and many-class classification tasks.
