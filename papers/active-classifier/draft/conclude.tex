\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we take a step towards the practical utilization of theoretical 
AL strategies. We combine AL strategies with a practical classification model fastText 
and evaluate the methods on multiple many-class datasets. 
Our work shows that with the increase of the classes, 
the problem becomes more sophisticated and more attention should be paid to 
balance the sampling results in order to achieve promising results. 
A possible avenue for future work is to consider a more general problem setting 
and come up with an approach which will generate consistent results on 
both few-class and many-class classification tasks.
