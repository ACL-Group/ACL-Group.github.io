% In this paper, we present an active learning framework and a number of
% strategies for training a many-class text classifier on relatively small
% number of labeled training data.

%Deep learning has been successfully applied to many natural language processing tasks including short text classification. 
%However, it usually requires a large amount of labeled data. 
%In order to reduce the cost and time for data annotation, active learning has been widely used to select the optimal samples to label. 
Previous studies on active learning are restricted to few-class text classification tasks. 
This paper examines different active learning approaches on multiple unbalanced 
many-class short text datasets using fastText classifier and sheds light 
on the performance changes with the increase of classes and different strategies. 
We further propose a new query strategy along with frequency adjustment feature 
which can be applied to earlier methods and yields good results on many-class text classification.
