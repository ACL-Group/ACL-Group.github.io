Dear Mrs. Zhang,

We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript, "Automatic Discovery of Adverse Reactions through Chinese Social Media", has been accepted for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery subject to you making required changes by 15 Oct 2018.

When preparing your revised manuscript, you are asked to carefully consider the editor and reviewer comments which are attached, and submit a list of responses to the comments.  Your list of responses should be uploaded as a file in addition to your revised manuscript.

In order to submit your revised manuscript please log on and you will find your submissions in submissions needing revision box.  Click submissions needing revision, click edit submission, click attach files, and upload your revised version.  It is essential that you use this process and not submit the manuscript as a new submission.

Please note: When uploading your revised files, please make sure only to submit your editable source files (i. E. Word, tex).

Also, if you opt for a tex file, only one .tex file per submission should be used to guarantee proper building.  If it doesn't build, it is because the .sty files also have to be uploaded.  EM does support most new versions of LaTex, but the older ones are not.  More details are listed at the bottom of this email should you need it.

COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:



Dear Mengxue Zhang,

It looks like your paper can be considered for publication in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery (see letter below). Congratulations!

However, before you paper can go into production,  please take some time to make sure that your paper is ready for printing. In particular:

- carefully read the author instructions that can be found at  https://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+&+information+retrieval/journal/10618, and make sure that your paper conforms to them. Your paper will be type-set by Springer, and not print in the way you turn it in. It is thus particularly important that you provide all information as required (e.g., citations and references).

- carefully spell-check not only the text of the paper, but also the references (in particular with respect to capitalization).

- double-check that your figures are legible in black-and-white. While a color version of your article will be available on-line, the article will be printed in black-and-white. In particular the red textual parts will all be black.

- please fix the bibliography, and provide full publication information for all entries (all page numbers, avoid citations to TRs and arxiv if they have been later published at different venues, provide full conference names in addition to abbreviations, etc.). This will help the readers (and the production staff at Springer) to identify the right publications.

- make sure to choose an appropriate short running title for your contribution and enter it into the corresponding macro in the LaTeX template. This is used to generate the title on the page headers.

best regards,

Johannes Fürnkranz

Dear Authors:

Thanks for your revised submission. Based on the reviewers' comments, I am pleased to accept it for publication subject to the specified revisions as pointed out by the reviewers. Please carefully read the reviewers' comments and make appropriate clarifications. Moreover, there are some important references on ADR prediction that the current manuscript is missing, for example,

Xiao, Cao, Ping Zhang, W. Art Chaowalitwongse, Jianying Hu, and Fei Wang. "Adverse drug reaction prediction with symbolic latent Dirichlet allocation." In Proceedings of the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2017.

Wang, Fei, Ping Zhang, Nan Cao, Jianying Hu, and Robert Sorrentino. "Exploring the associations between drug side-effects and therapeutic indications." Journal of biomedical informatics 51 (2014): 15-23.

The authors may want to discuss the relationships between their proposed methods and the technologies proposed in these research works. I look forward to your revision.

Action Editor.

Reviewer #2: DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY REVIEW FORM:

DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IS A LEADING VENUE FOR ARCHIVAL PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH IN THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY.  PAPERS SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST HIGH STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP, PRESENTATION AND EXPECTED IMPACT.



SUMMARY. PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE MANUSCRIPT?

The authors answered most of my previous questions.


RELEVANCE. HOW RELEVANT IS THE PAPER TO THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY?

Very relevant.


SIGNIFICANCE [NOT APPLICABLE TO SURVEY PAPERS]. HOW SIGNIFICANTLY DOES THE PAPER ADVANCE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART? HOW BIG AN IMPACT WILL THE PAPER HAVE, ON WHAT AREAS, AND WHY?  WILL THE PAPER STIMULATE FURTHER RESEARCH?

First paper on using Chinese social media to mine ADRs.


RELATED RESEARCH.  IS ALL RELEVANT PRIOR WORK DISCUSSED? IS THE CURRENT WORK A DISTINCT AND NEW CONTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO THE AUTHOR(S)' PREVIOUS WORK?  [NOTE, DMKD ENCOURAGES SUBMISSION OF EXPANDED VERSIONS OF SIGNIFICANT WORK PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN CONFERENCES, SO LONG AS THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE EARLIER WORK IS ACKNOWLEDGED, BUT STRONGLY CONDEMNS BOTH PLAGIARISM AND SELF-PLAGIARISM.  SEE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS FOR MORE DETAILS.] 
[NOTE ALSO THAT DMKD CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES ANY SUGGESTION BY A REVIEWER THAT THEIR OWN WORK SHOULD BE REFERENCED AND RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DELETE ANY SUCH COMMENTS FROM A REVIEW. WHERE A REVIEWER BELIEVES THEIR OWN WORK SHOULD BE CITED,WE ADVISE WRITING A COMMENT TO THE EDITORS UNDER CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS TO THE EDITOR.]

Yes


RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH [NOT APPLICABLE TO SURVEY PAPERS]. IS THE NOVEL CONTRIBUTION OF THE NEW WORK MADE EXPLICIT TOGETHER WITH ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR WORK?  IS THE NEED FOR THE NEW CONTRIBUTION SUBSTANTIATED?  DOES THE PAPER MAKE CLEAR NOT ONLY 
THE STRENGTH BUT ALSO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW CONTRIBUTION?

Yes, paper contribution was made clear: (1) use of Chinese social media, a new data resource and (2) automatic label generation algorithm that require little manual annotation.


THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION. IS THE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION SOUND AND APPROPRIATE. ARE ALL CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE BACKED BY SUFFICIENT THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT? IS APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDED OF EXPERIMENTAL 
RESULTS AND ARE APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN?

Yes.

EXPRESSION. IS THE PAPER CLEARLY WRITTEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE OF DATA MINING RESEARCHERS?  IF NOT, WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES ARE REQUIRED? IS THE ENGLISH EXPRESSION OF A SUITABLE STANDARD FOR PUBLICATION?  IS THE PAPER OF APPROPRIATE LENGTH? IF NOT, WHAT SHOULD BE ADDED, EXPANDED, DELETED OR COMPRESSED? DO THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT APPROPRIATELY REFLECT THE CONTENTS?

Mostly.


TECHNICAL DETAIL.  IS SUFFICIENT DETAIL PROVIDED ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES?  IS THERE SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO ALLOW REPLICATION OF THE WORK?

Yes.


FIGURES AND TABLES.  ARE THE FIGURES AND TABLES NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT?

Yes.

REFERENCES.  ARE THE REFERENCES ACCURATE AND COMPLETE?

Yes.

FOR SURVEY PAPERS ONLY:
- IS A SURVEY IN THIS AREA TIMELY?    [IS THE AREA OF INTEREST TO 
  THE DATA MINING COMMUNITY AND IS THERE NO RECENT AND COMPREHENSIVE 
  REVIEW ALREADY AVAILABLE?] 
- IS THE COVERAGE OF THE AREA BALANCED, COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE? 
- DOES THE SURVEY PROVIDE A SUITABLE FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE AREA? 




ANY OTHER COMMENTS NOT COVERED ABOVE.



SUMMARIZE ANY CHANGES THAT MUST BE MADE FOR A REVISED VERSION OF THIS PAPER TO BE ACCEPTABLE FOR PUBLICATION.

1.	In section 2.2.2, the authors described the issues with Weibo posts and in consequence it is not used for finding the potential ADRs. Were Weibo posts used in any of the parts in the framework? If not, there is no need to include in the manuscript.
2.	Sentence on Page 19, "This is the most valuable discovery for the drug maker in the analysis of the drug reactions in perhaps a small population previously not considered" needs rephrasing, don't understand what it means.


SUMMARIZE ANY FURTHER CHANGES THAT YOU RECOMMEND THE AUTHOR(S)
CONSIDER.


Reviewer #3: The authors addressed most of comments that I asked last time. Some minor modifications are necessary.
(1)	FDA Spontaneous reporting system dose allow consumers to submit ADR reports. However, most of consumers are not aware of this option. In addition, their Internet use behavior leans more on social media platform.
(2)	I think the main potential of using social media data is mining common and unserious symptomatic ADRs rather than the rare ones since most of consumers do not have knowledge to self diagnose their experienced ADRs. For example, they may complain about extremely itchy (a symptom of angioedema) instead of angioedema. 
(3)	I would suggest introducing weibo data in the introduction and emphasizing that the authors did not use it due to existing challenges.

STYLE FILE INFORMATION:

Questions on submitting Tex files:

What submission item should I use for a Tex file?  The best submission item to use for a tex file is a "Manuscript" or similar worded submission item description.

What if my Tex file(s) doesn't build?  First, look in the PDF to see if an error message is available.  If the error message suggests you are missing a sty file, then this may be the cause that the Tex submission will not build.   If your submission still is not building after attempting to fix your Tex file from the suggested error message, you may want to verify the following:

Are your images referenced correctly? Images cannot be referenced in subfolders, otherwise they will not appear in the PDF

Are all your accompanying files referenced correctly in your Tex file?

Why can't  I submit Tex files and DVI files together?  The System will accept either a Tex file(s) _OR_ a DVI file.  If your DVI file does not build, then it is suggested you instead submit a Tex file.  If you submit a DVI file and it does not build correctly, then you will need to provide the Tex file in order for the building problem to be researched.    

What if my figures are not appearing? It may be possible that your images are referenced in subfolders.  Images cannot be referenced in subfolders, otherwise they will not appear in the PDF.  One example of a correctly referenced image is: epsfig{figure=alld.eps,width=.5	extwidth} .   An example of an incorrectly referenced image is: epsfig{figure=images/alld.eps,width=.5	extwidth}

What if I view large or cut off EPS images?  If you view large or cut off images, then you will need to resize the image to fit on one 8.5 x 11 page.  When there is a problem caused by not resizing PostScript files (the images get cut off…) the author will either need to resize the images or save the files in a format that EM can recognize as an image.( Perhaps as a TIFF or a JPEG). Please note that EPS files are the best choice for image files in Tex submissions.

Do I need to use my STY files too?  Yes.  The sty files will be needed to properly build your submission.
What if I see (?) Question marks in my PDF?  If you see question marks in the references of your PDF, most likely your Tex file(s) are in subdirectories. Tex submissions cannot include subdirectories for your submission to properly build.  All associated files must be in one directory for the submission to build.

Please note:
1)       The best image/figure file types for Tex submissions are EPS files.  The author should attempt to submit EPS images for all their figure files.  The author should verify that their EPS images are not in subfolders, otherwise the files may not build into the submission

2)       The author should look at the error generated at the end of their Tex submission.  The author should verify the format of their Tex submission, as the error message suggests the Tex file may be corrupt.

3)       The author should re-verify that the submission and all of their accompanying Tex related files (STY files, etc) are uploaded to the submission

4)       The author should then re-build their submission.

5)	The author verify their images are not in subfolders, otherwise the images may not appear.

For your reference, a sty file is:

STY is the file extension for a Style sheet file. A STYle template may be used by different publishers to define what should be bold/centered/italic in the paper.
