COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR:





Dear Authors,

Thank you for your submission to Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery.  I have received three reviews of your paper.  On the basis of these reviews I am not able to accept your manuscript in its current form.  However, if you revise the manuscript paying careful attention to the reviewersâ€™ comments I would be pleased to receive the revision for another round of review.  Please address the issues raised by the reviewers, especially clarification on the novelty of your proposed methods as well as the rationale behind the experimental design. Moreover, some data articles on related topics are missing, for example,

Xiao, C., Zhang, P., Chaovalitwongse, W.A., Hu, J. and Wang, F., 2017, February. Adverse Drug Reaction Prediction with Symbolic Latent Dirichlet Allocation. In AAAI (pp. 1590-1596).
Zhang, P., Wang, F., Hu, J. and Sorrentino, R., 2015. Label propagation prediction of drug-drug interactions based on clinical side effects. Scientific reports, 5.

It would be good if the authors can discuss the relationships between their proposed work and those existing research.


Please include with your resubmission a detailed response to reviewers, explaining how each issue has been addressed or why you feel there is no need to address it.

Please note that addressing one issue sometimes raises new issues that were not previously apparent, so there is no guarantee that the paper will be accepted even if you do address all issues raised.

I look forward to receiving your revised manuscript should you decide to resubmit.

Yours sincerely,

Fei Wang

Reviewer #1: In this paper, the authors proposed a semi-supervised learning method for mining online patient data in Chinese in order to automatically detect adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The results showed that some interesting ADRs, which might need formal and rigorous verifications clinically. 

The paper sounds interesting but the quality of the research can be improved, together with language clarity. The following are an incomplete list of examples: 

1) In the Introduction section on page 3, the authors claim that the paper mines three popular Chinese social media, but on page 8, the authors also stated that in consequence, we DO NOT use the data from Weibo. 

2) On page 5, 79 drugs of interest are listed in Appendix A but on page 8, we only use the combination of data from Xunyiwenyao and Haodaifu to find the potential ADRs for the 46 drugs of interest. 

3) On page 13, the authors claim that feature 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 are the most important ones. However, the Table 3 shows that feature 2 and 4 give high F1 scores and the lowest F1 score comes from feature 5. These are very confusing.
 
4) The algorithm details of the automatic generating labels are not very clear. As discussed on page 11, section 2.3.4, the authors used both package insert and SVM method to get the data labels but it is not clear how to trade off these two methods?
 
5) On page 13, section 3.1, it seems that the authors gradually train the SVM model and extend the training set. It is very curious that how many training data is extended in each iteration?
 
6) On page 15, Table 4, only SVM methods show the results using auto labels from inserts. How about other methods such as pattern-based, HMM and CRF?


Reviewer #2: DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY REVIEW FORM:

DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IS A LEADING VENUE FOR ARCHIVAL PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH IN THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY.  PAPERS SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST HIGH STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP, PRESENTATION AND EXPECTED IMPACT.



SUMMARY. PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE MANUSCRIPT?
The manuscript describes a semi-supervised learning framework to identify positive associations between drug use and ADRs using data from three popular Chinese social media. The framework consisted of four parts: lexicon construction, candidate ADR extraction, evidence classification, and ranking. Mining ADRs from Chinese social media data is novel. Building customized lexicon required a lot of effort. But there are concerns about the details of the method and findings that require additional work and clarification.

- IS THE COVERAGE OF THE AREA BALANCED, COMPLETE AND UP-TO-DATE? 
- DOES THE SURVEY PROVIDE A SUITABLE FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE AREA? 




ANY OTHER COMMENTS NOT COVERED ABOVE.



SUMMARIZE ANY CHANGES THAT MUST BE MADE FOR A REVISED VERSION OF THIS PAPER TO BE ACCEPTABLE FOR PUBLICATION.
1.	In the Introduction, the authors stated that the quantity of spontaneous reports are limited thus cannot catch many infrequent ADRs. I don't think the spontaneous reports are limited by its quantity; rather it is limited by the underreporting. In any way, it should not be the direct cause of the inability to identify rare signals.
2.	When people discuss their medication usage online, lay language are typically used, so formal medication names may not be used in online discussions. Does your customized lexicon consider this possibility?
3.	What is the precision/recall for the customized lexicon for medication and ADR in recognizing the actual terms?
4.	In section 2.2.2, the authors described the issues with Weibo posts and in consequence it is not used for finding the potential ADRs. Were Weibo posts used in any of the parts in the framework?
5.	A potential ADR term like 'cough' could be a side effect or indication of a drug. By setting a distance threshold of 55 Chinese words or less as a context does not seem to solve the problem.
6.	Learning model built from the manual annotation of 600 positive and 600 negative samples can be used to automatically label the remaining samples. Why do you need to do this iteratively? How does this approach relate to active learning?
7.	Ranking is done according the frequency of the positive evidences minus the negative evidence. What if the drug indication is discussed much more frequently resulting in more negative evidence? Would the ranking score be negatives? Wouldn't calculations based on % of positive and negative evidence make more sense?


SUMMARIZE ANY FURTHER CHANGES THAT YOU RECOMMEND THE AUTHOR(S)
CONSIDER.
8.	Since the major contribution of the study is the use of Chinese social media data, did the study identify anything interesting that is different from what is already known for the US population?


Reviewer #3: The authors proposed a semi-supervised framework to mine drug adverse drug reaction (ADR) pairs in two types of Chinese Social Media data. The research topic is significant given that ADRs have been detrimental to patients and caused tremendous finical lost to pharmaceutical companies. However, the study design of this paper has major flaws:
(1). The authors created a well-balanced training and testing data set which include the same number of positive cases and negative cases, and then trained the classifiers based on these datasets. The ratio of positive/negative cases is extremely different from real-world scenario where drug ADR mentions are quite rare in the social media. It is in great doubt that whether the learned classifier could be used in the real world scenario. 
(2). The authors considered the sentences mentioning drug ADR as positive cases, and the sentences mentioning drug indication as negative cases, ignoring cases when merely co-occurrence relationship exist between drug and medical condition. I believe that the third kind of relationship is also common in the social media that raises the concern regarding why the authors do not take this relationship into account.  The authors claimed the method is doing well to rank the drug ADR pair higher in the list while rank the drug indication pair lower. This measurement is totally biased since the classifiers have been trained to do so.  It is also suspected that the rule-based system could do well in this task.
(3). It is not a fair comparison among three methods including HMM, CRF and SVM since they are trained using different data sets. So the results in Table 4 could be invalid.
(5) The features used in the study are quite add hoc - did authors select them in a systematic way?
(6). The authors mentioned three data sources including haodaifu, xunyiwenyao and weibo, but they have never used weibo in the study.  The description of weibo data in both introduction and data collection sections has led to confusion.
There are many typos in the manuscript. For example, neither statins nor anesthesia is a kind of disease in table 2. 

In summary, the proposed method and framework is not novel, and the application is not solid as the extracted/selected data is completely different from the real world data. Therefore, I doubt what is new knowledge has been added by this manuscript.
