\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclu}
We have proposed an effective framework for extracting and analyzing ADRs from Chinese online social media. It uses a lexicon-based method to extract ADRs from the data followed by a binary classifier to identify the positive evidences. In this framework, we introduce a data-driven algorithm to extend the drug and ADR lexica. In order to build the evidence classifier, we propose an automatic labeling algorithm to produce large amounts of labeled sentences. Completely relying on the information from the package inserts produces training data which is too noisy. Our tradeoff is a semi-supervised approach where we manually label a small set, then use these data and package inserts collectively to generate more training data. This approach was shown to be highly effective.
