Action Editor:
We have included these two papers by Xiao and Wang in our introduction part. Two papers mentioned here predict ADRs during the drug development cycle and could be done before the drug entering the market. One paper discovers that drug indication is useful for predicting ADR. Another paper uses drug structure to get the higher ADR prediction accuracy. However, one fact is that some ADRs could only be learned when the drug is used in a wide spectrum of patients. Social media became a great source to mine the ADR information.


Reviewer #2:
2.1 We have removed Weibo in original section 2.2.2, but we add a brief discussion of Weibo data into the introduction part. As Weibo is one of the largest social media in China, people will come up with Weibo data naturally when need to mine information from social media. Hence we add a short paragraph in the introduction part to explain why we do not use Weibo data in our experiment.  

2.2 We have re-organized this sentence into "This is the most valuable discovery for the drug maker in the analysis of the drug reactions because some ADRs may not be observed during the trials on a small population."


Reviewer #3:
3.1 Right. We added the "unawareness of patients" as one reason for small quantity of official adverse event reports.

3.2 Yes, most patients do not have sufficient knowledge to self diagnose. However, the ADRs mined from social media could motivate specialist to do the detailed analysis of those ADRs. 

3.3 Please see the response 2.1. We moved the section 2.2.2 and summarize it in the introduction part to explain why we do not use Weibi data.
