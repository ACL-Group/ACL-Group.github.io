*16: Detailed comments for the authors
  The paper is clearly written and interesting. Although some typos and other grammatical issues should be fixed, e.g., “a unsupervised”, “Proposed a new framekwork”, “we discussed and compare”… – I would advise using a language editor to review the paper. Also, rather put the figures and table after you mention them in the text.
The method is sound and innovative and the experiments were appropriately designed. A discussion about the limitations of the method and possible future work is missing. Also it would be interesting to see if adjusting the number of clusters to different

*8: Summary of the paper's main contribution and impact
  The paper proposed a multiple stage methods to solve the problem of aspect mining. The multiple stage approaches combined various techniques, such as sentence clustering via RNN, topic modeling, word2vector and word ranking to improve the performance of topic modeling based approach. 
It demonstrated the improvements on a real world data set by comparing multiple approaches. The ground truth is collected via human. It is a solid paper. However, usually with complicated system which uses various techniques in multiple stages, it is hard to tell the impact of each individual piece to the whole system and it is also different to reproduce the results without knowing all the specific parameters used in each step. I would recommend as a short paper.

*10: Three strong points of this paper (please number each point)
  1. Solid experiments evaluation on real world data set and human labeling. 
2. Good presentation.

*11: Three weak points of this paper (please number each point)
  1. Need to more detailed description on all the parameters used in the experiments in order to reproduce results. 
2. Please discuss how to extract phrases instead of only words as aspects.

*16: Detailed comments for the authors
  Are the aspects extracted by your method all single words? 

How would you solve the problem if the aspects are actually phrases, such as "screen resolution" or "screen size" instead of a general word "screen"?

*8: Summary of the paper's main contribution and impact
  The paper presents an unsupervised learning framework for aspect extraction from user reviews. The framework consists of five steps which are based on clustering and ranking algorithms. The empirical analysis is performed on multiple real datasets.

*9: Justification of your recommendation
  The paper aims to tackle the aspect extraction problem which is part of the automatic review summarization. The results are practically useful when compared to existing work. However, the technical novelty of the proposed framework is not very significant, as it is largely based on established techniques.

*10: Three strong points of this paper (please number each point)
  1. The paper addresses an interesting problem in review summarization.
2. The authors perform extensive experiments on real data.

*11: Three weak points of this paper (please number each point)
  1. The presentation of the paper could be much improved.
2. The theoretical novelty of the paper is not very strong.

*15: If the paper is accepted, which format would you suggest?
  [_] Regular Paper
  [X] Short Paper
  
*16: Detailed comments for the authors
  The aspect extraction problem studied is well motivated by real-world applications. The authors propose a multistage framework which combines some unsupervised learning methods. The main concern I have with the paper is the lack of theoretical analysis of the proposed approach. On the other hand, the framework mainly leverages existing and classical methods, such as distributed representations, and text clustering. 

The empirical analysis is relatively thorough. A number of experiments on real data are provided against the state-of-the-art methods. The results support the usefulness of the proposed framework.

The presentation of the paper could be greatly improved as it lacks clarity. There are also quite a few typos, e.g., in the experiments section, vectrs should be vectors.
