\chapter{Conclusion}

In this paper, we first made a general introduction to sentiment analysis, talking about the motivation and potential power of such research; we talked about the tasks in sentiment analysis, including classification, extraction and summarization; we introduced several popular methods for sentiment analysis, including linguistics features, topic model and its variations, and finally deep learning for natural language processing, with an emphasis on language modeling and sentence representation. We then focus on the problem we try to tackle in this paper, that is, aspect extraction for aspect-based review summarization; we explained why this task is difficult and why models like LDA won't work well. After analyzing our problem, we proposed our multistage clustering framework, which carries out clustering from coarse to fine grain. Our proposed method is a purely unsupervised method, which means it does not require any human labeling. We compared our model with several other models, including MG-LDA, which is designed specifically for aspect extraction and has been very popular since proposed. We demonstrated that our method out-performed all other models on multiple product types, varying from hotels to laptops.
