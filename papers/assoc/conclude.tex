\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}


%We studied the problem of computing relatedness for between word and
%text pairs. Our first contribution is to consider five types of
%Wikipedia co-occurrences, leveraging its rich structure and meta
%data. Second contribution is to leverage human
%perception, expressed in a well-studied form of free association, to
%bridge the gap of textual co-occurrences from human-perceived
%relatedness. 
We synthetically
build an association network, by aggregating Wikipedia
signals, using free association as a training data. 
%We then validated relatedness computed from our proposed network.
 Our evaluation results
validated that our proposed framework reaches state-of-the-art
in a standard benchmark for term relatedness computation and
outperforms all other state-of-the-arts for short text similarity
computation by a significant margin.
