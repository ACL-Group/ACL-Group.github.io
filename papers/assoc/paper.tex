\begin{abstract}
To judge how much a pair of words (or texts) are semantically related is a
cognitive process. However, previous algorithms for computing semantic
relatedness are largely based on co-occurrences within textual
windows, and do not actively leverage cognitive human perceptions of
relatedness. To bridge this perceptional gap, we propose to utilize
free association as signals to capture such human perceptions.
However, free association, being manually evaluated,
has limited lexical coverage and is inherently sparse. 
We propose to expand lexical coverage and overcome sparseness by 
constructing an association network of terms and concepts 
that combines signals from free association norms and 
five types of co-occurrences extracted from the
rich structures of Wikipedia. Our evaluation results validate that
simple algorithms on this network give competitive results in
computing semantic relatedness between words and between short
texts.
%
%The process how people associate one concept with another is a fundament topic
%in cognitive science, and a better understanding of this process can help us
%model the real activity of human mind, thus provide better solutions to
%various problems in NLP (Natural Language Processing), data mining, information
%retrieval and related fields. Semantic relatedness computing, for example, is
%a typical problem related to this process.
%In this paper, we construct a concept association network harnessed from Wikipedia, and then based on the constructed network we present a basic algorithm as well as a HMM
%(Hidden Markov Model) based algorithm to compute the association probability between two terms, and to reveal how the two terms are connected in a near-human mind drifting process. Experiments show that the proposed approach can be used to better measure term relatedness, achieving competitive result with state-of-the-art approaches in such tasks.
%Experiments show that this new algorithm performs better than
%common algorithms based on co-occurrence and previous algorithms
%modeling the association process.
