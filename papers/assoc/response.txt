We appreciate the precious comments by the reviewers and their hard work. Below are our responses. 

R1:
*** "They seem to suggest that the corpus based approach taken by them is somehow superior than hand-crafted lexical taxonomies like WordNet(Miller 1995).They fail to acknowledge that Wikipedia information that they are using is also hand crafted"
Answer: Taxonomy based approaches heavily rely on hand-crafted knowledge, and thus have two main drawbacks: 1) limited lexical coverage 2) difficulty in applying existing algorithms to new languages. Corpus based approaches that mine from Wikipedia text do not suffer from these drawbacks, because though Wikipedia is hand crafted, it is essentially different from WordNet in that: 1) it is contributed by an extremely large community instead of a few linguistic experts, thus has a much larger lexical coverage 2) it is available in more than 200 different languages, thus applying Wikipedia based algorithms to new languages is much easier.

*** "Why not consider a similarity metric that combines what the authors have created with a wordnet based method?"
Answer: We agree that this is a reasonable idea, and there are a few attempts that combine taxonomy-based and corpus-based approaches in the literature (as discussed in the related work section). We focus on the exploration of new types of co-occurrence and leveraging signals from free association in this paper, and would like to consider hybrid methods as future work.

R2:
*** "The paper's english is a bit sloppy in places... i.e., this is a concept paper?"
Answer: Thank you for the suggestion. We will definitely improve the English and revise some of the wordings in the revised version.

R3:
*** "Rather than define what is meant by this signal, the authors claim that incorporating more sources of co-occurrence and training model parameters via free association data will bridge the gap."
Answer: "Human perception signals", in this paper, refer to the free association produced by human, which we leverage for semantic relatedness computation. This was defined in Para. 3 of introduction: "As a human perception signal to bridge such gap, we consider a well-studied psychological process called free association".

*** "This paper may be an appropriate paper for a general AI or, more likely, NLP/IR, venue but not the cognitive systems track."
Answer: We submit our paper in the cognitive systems track for the following reasons:
1) Free association, which we leverage as a key source of signals in this paper, is the product of human cognition.
2) Computing semantic relatedness, the problem we solve here, is a critical building block in natural language understanding, one of the major topics in cognitive systems.
3) The association network we syntheize in this paper can be viewed as a reproduction of the real-world free association (a kind of human cognitive ability), which is much larger than the Florida free association norms.

Having said the above, we are also fine with the paper relocated to the main
conference track, if that is more appropriate.

*** "section 3.7 talks to execution time of extracting values from the network, but is it possible to incrementally add new terms/concepts/weights? how long would that take?"
Answer: The primary time cost for building the network is on extracting co-occurrences from Wikipedia corpus, which can be done within 10 hours on a 2GHz computer, and can be much faster if parallelized. At this rate, we consider it possible to rebuild the network from scratch periodically. On the other hand, incremental update to the network is not difficult: since most Wikipedia pages are relatively stable, we only need to extract new co-occurrences from the updated pages  or new pages by comparing the timestamps with the time the network was last built. 

*** "...the paper introduces each of the new co-occurrence sources, with examples, but fails to explain how/why these better access the human perception signal."
Answer: In this paper, "human perception signal" refers to free association and not co-occurrences in text corpus. Please refer to first response in R3.

*** "I feel that I would have liked to have seen an experiment showing just the effect of free association training, possibly with another approach (this seems to be a major source of 'human perception')"
Answer: Sec 3.5 and Table 5 describe an experiment showing exactly the effect of free association training. A more appropriate heading for Sec 3.5 might be "effects of different co-occurrences and free association training". Every approach of semantic relatedness computation has its own framework, many of which are not even supervised. There is no universal and easy way to integrate free association signals into every such framework. Our work showcased the power of free association in a particular framework, which may encourage further study on semantic relatedness empowered by free association.
