****************************************
What is the contribution of this paper to the image processing community (a couple of sentences)?

In this paper, we propose a framework for textual information extraction from semi-structured bio-medical images. From the traditional OCR results, which contain lots of noises and errors, we propose a fuzzy match strategy to extract useful information and an incremental correction framework to correct the errors. 

****************************************
Why is this contribution significant (What impact will it have)?

Lots of medical images are printed and stored on paper everyday. 
According to AstraZeneca, one of the largest pharmaceurtical companies in
the world, more than 400 EMR paper reports are produced in an average
hospital per month. With the help of our system, these printed images 
can be easily digitized. Our system can also be applied to other 
semi-structured images, such as invoices, patents and datasheets etc.

****************************************
What is distinctive/new about the current paper relative to these previously published works?

First, unlike previous systems, our system can be used on any 
semi-structured images, and not restricted to tables and forms. 
Our system is flexible enough to only describe the localized textual 
data in the images instead of the entire structure. 

Second, our system allows users to specify the rough layout of the 
document images. Some style-directed layout analysis algorithms also 
allow users to specify physical layouts, though at a coarser level. 
Our system has better tolerance to noises in the images than the 
previous attempts, because lexical symbols in our system are words and 
not lines, and our system employs a fuzzy matching strategy. 

Last but not least, our system is capable of modeling dependencies between 
text blocks. Those dependencies, especially algebraic relations in the 
case of numerical content, can be specified in the constraint descriptions. 
To the best of our knowledge, no other existing systems have this useful 
feature.
