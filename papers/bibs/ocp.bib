  author = {Ili\`{e}s Alouini and Peter Van Roy},
  abstract = {In any wide-area distributed system such as the Internet, fault tolerance is crucial for real-world applications.  We describe a new
 practical fault-tolerant mobile agent platform. The agent platform is built
 on the top of the Mozart system using a ``global store'' abstraction
 that provides a globally coherent and fault tolerant memory. The global
 store looks like a set of objects which are accessed using a transactional 
 interface.  Instances of the global store are used for two purposes:
 to store the agent state and to communicate with the agent. The store is 
 lightweight, requires no persistence, and is independent of the file system.  
 Processes can be added to or removed from the store dynamically.  With $n$ 
 processes, the store tolerates up to $n-1$ fail-stop process failures.
 This is adequate for fault tolerance on a LAN; we are working on extending
 the store for network partitioning, so that it will be adequate also on the
 complete Internet.  The store can migrate without dependencies, i.e., the
 migration depends on no fixed process.  Mozart is a general-purpose 
 development
 platform for open, robust distributed applications that is based on the Oz
 language.  A beta version of the global store is implemented completely
 within Oz using Mozart's reflective fault model.  The beta version has been
 publicly released in the Mozart Global User Library.},

  year = {1997},
  author = {Seif Haridi and Peter Van Roy and Gert Smolka},
  abstract = {We present a design for a distributed programming system, Distributed Oz, that abstracts away the network. This means that all network
 operations are invoked implicitly by the system as an incidental
 result of using particular language constructs. However, since network
 operations are expensive, the programmer must retain control over
 network communication patterns. This control is provided through the
 language constructs. While retaining their centralized semantics, they
 are extended with a distributed semantics. Distributed Oz is an
 extension of Oz, a concurrent state-aware language with first-class
 procedures. Distributed Oz extends Oz with just two concepts: mobility
 control and asynchronous ordered communication. Mobility control
 provides for truly mobile objects in a simple and clean
 way. Asynchronous ordered communication allows to conveniently build
 servers. These two concepts give the programmer a control over network
 communications that is both simple and predictable. We give scenarios
 to show how common distributed programming tasks can be implemented
 efficiently. There are two reasons for the simplicity of Distributed
 Oz. First, Oz has a simple formal semantics.  Second, the distributed
 extension is built using network protocols that are natural extensions
 to the centralized language operations. We discuss the operational
 semantics of Oz and Distributed Oz and the architecture of the
 distributed implementation. We give an overview of the basic network
 protocols for communication and mobility.},
