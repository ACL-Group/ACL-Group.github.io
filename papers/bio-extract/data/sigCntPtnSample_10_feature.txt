	u 17244529 83427 37237 binds 1 4 2 | gnb2l1 binds to elongin-c and promotes ubiquitination of hif1a
	u 20007317 832206 3361397 binds 4 7 5 | in saga , sus1 binds to sgf11 and has been proposed to provide a link between saga and trex-2
	u 10377438 380450 14011 binds 5 8 6 | our studies show that ube2i binds to etv6 exclusively through the hlh domain of etv6
	u 17502380 399396 20276 binds 5 8 6 | previous work found that nedd4l binds to scnn1a via py motifs located in the c termini of alpha- , beta- , and gammaenac
	u 16818237 11277 56086 binds 1 4 2 | trex1 binds to set and colocalizes and translocates with the set complex
	u 12515806 93742 5818 binds 5 8 6 | we show here that pard3 binds to pvrl1 and -3 in neuroepithelial cells of the embryonic telencephalon , which are equipped with ajs , but not with typical tjs
	u 10823961 23054 12914 binds 5 8 6 | the c terminus of ncoa6 binds to crebbp and med23 , a component of the drip/trap/arc complex , which suggests that ncoa6 may activate transcription by means of such interactions
	u 16735578 851083 852477 binds 1 4 2 | mdm30 binds to fzo1 and , dependent on its f-box , mediates proteolysis of fzo1
	u 14559896 9530 339 binds 1 4 2 | bag4 binds to apobec1 via its n-terminal region independent of the bag domain
	u 11130076 108100 34519 binds 16 19 17 | activated akt1 binds to the amino terminus of baiap2 , and carboxy-terminal src-homology-3 domain of baiap2 binds to scar to form a trimolecular complex
	u 11290702 839143 2541975 binds 5 8 6 | coprecipitation experiments revealed that tem1 binds to cdc15 in vivo
	u 8810278 12929 25 binds 28 31 29 | we have previously shown that crkl , but not the related adapter protein c-crk , is tyrosine phosphorylated in cell lines transformed by abl1 , and that crkl binds to abl1 through the crkl-sh3 domains
	u 11551505 81650 21374 binds 6 9 7 | the fca regulatory subunit of csnk2b binds to tbp and is required for high tbp-associated csnk2b activity and dnapol-alpha60 eig71ec transcription in unstressed cells
	u 10409727 20218 94212 binds 23 26 24 | we also show that the rna helicase activity previously ascribed to khdrbs1 is dispensable for the esr1 psmd4 coactivator activity and that khdrbs1 binds to pag1 in vitro
