\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Tuple}
A Tuple indicates a pair of related proteins, formed as $\langle protein\_1,protein\_2\rangle$. For example, $\langle HIPK1,p53\rangle$ stands for a relationship between "HIPK1" and "p53".
Notice that it is possible that one protein possesses multiple interactions with other proteins respectively.

\subsection{Triplet}
A Triplet specifies the exact interaction type between two related proteins, formed as $\langle\langle protein\_1,protein\_2\rangle,interaction\_type\rangle$ For example, $\langle\langle HIPK1,p53\rangle, regulation\rangle$ not only suggest the existence of relationship between "HIPK1" and "p53", but specify the exact relationship to be "regulation" as well.
