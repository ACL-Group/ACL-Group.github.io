\subsection{Generating Candidate Tuples}
\label{GenTuples}

After candidate patterns are generated and evaluated, \emph{PPISnowball} system scans whole documents set to discover new triplets. Initially, \emph{PPISnowball} identify all sentences which possess at least two different proteins and at least one interaction words. If there are \emph{n (n$\geq$2)} proteins and \emph{k (k$\geq$1)} interaction words are spotted in a sentence, then the number of total possible candidate triplets is $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} n\\2 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$)*k. For each possible candidate triplet $\langle\langle protein\_1,protein\_2\rangle,interaction\rangle$, we generate its pattern \emph{P} based on the surrounding context in the sentence. If the pattern \emph{P} exactly hits the candidate patterns set, the tuple within that triplet is accepted for further evaluation in next step.
