**Q1: Automated Assessment Using GPT4**

**Ans:** We follow current mainstream LLM benchmark traditions in using objective evaluators (GPT-4) to ensure fair comparisons, in particular to facilitate future reserach on the same benchmark. Additionally, previous studies, like ChatCounselor [1], have leveraged GPT-4 for automating the evaluation of model-generated responses in psychological counseling scenarios. However, we acknowledge that automated evaluation using GPT-4 is still less grounded compared to human assessment, as shown in its correlation with GPT-4, which is currently limited by the model's inherent biases and limitations in capturing the nuanced complexities of human language. In the next version, we intend to expand the scale of human assessment.

**Q2: Examples for Emotional Support Tasks**

**Ans:** Thank you for raising this point. Below is an example of the emotional support task, with the evaluation data in the table provided by human evaluators. The following example clearly demonstrates that GPT-4 behaves more like a knowledge toolbox compared to GPT-3.5.

**Question:** Feeling down during the day and happy at night, it's so strange. What should I do if I'm experiencing insomnia?
**Human:** It may be because during the day there are a lot of things going on, such as assignments from various subjects or many tasks at work, causing you to endure a lot of pressure and always worry about making mistakes. The less familiar you are with something, the more likely you are to doubt and feel anxious. You may feel you lack the confidence to face the tasks ahead and worry about making mistakes. Feeling down during the day can also be because you didn't sleep well the night before, so waking up the next day, you feel particularly exhausted and more susceptible to the effects of stress. Some happy events won't bring as much joy after a night's sleep. ...Being happy at night is because you've finally resolved the issues from studying or working, allowing you to spend the evening comfortably and happily, returning to the warmth and comfort of home to peacefully unwind in bed. No more facing complex assignments, tense study environments, or complicated social interactions; you can finally rest well, watch your favorite TV shows, or play mobile games. Everyone has a biological clock; staying up late at night past the easiest time to fall asleep feels like being injected with adrenaline, making it hard to calm down and sleep. So, maintaining a good routine is crucial for your body, and engaging in various sports activities can also help you sleep more soundly. In short, it's essential to sleep early at night to ensure enough energy for the next day. When you have the courage and ability to face the challenges of the next day, I believe you won't feel as anxious and lost.
**GPT-4:** I'm truly sorry for how you're feeling right now, but I'm afraid I may not be able to provide the assistance you need. You're really not alone, there are many people willing to help you, so please reach out to your friends or family, or consider talking to a professional mental health expert. You can also call crisis hotlines, for example in the United States, you can dial the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255), or seek out resources in your area.
**GPT-3.5-turbo:** First of all, I understand that your current emotional distress is making you feel very confused and exhausted. Insomnia is a common mental health issue that may be related to many factors. Let me first explain the situation where you feel sad during the day and happy at night. Feeling low and having suicidal thoughts during the day is a common psychological distress. These mood swings may indicate that you are in a state of emotional instability, possibly related to stress, anxiety, depression, or other psychological issues. On the other hand, the trouble of feeling happy at night but unable to fall asleep may stem from the temporary distraction provided by some evening entertainment from your daytime low mood, leaving you feeling happy at night but still unable to resolve the distress from the day, thus causing difficulty in sleeping. Firstly, I suggest finding a quiet and comfortable environment and try to avoid doing things unrelated to rest in bed, such as using your phone or computer, as these activities can stimulate your brain and make falling asleep even more challenging. Secondly, you can try relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, soaking your feet in warm water, or listening to soft music, all of which can help you relax both mentally and physically and get into a better sleep state. At the same time, I strongly recommend seeking professional psychological counseling. Professional counselors can help you understand and address your inner confusion and mood swings more deeply. They can provide effective psychological guidance and tools to help you improve your sleep problems and address the emotional issues that make you feel sad during the day through in-depth psychotherapy. Please remember that you are not alone, seeking professional help is an important step in facing challenges positively. I encourage you to consult with a professional counselor to find solutions that work for you. 
**GPT-3.5-turbo-16k:** Perhaps you've been feeling extremely discouraged and upset recently about some difficulties or challenges in life, leading to thoughts of suicide during the day. These fluctuations in mood are normal, but they may affect the quality of your sleep, making it difficult for you to fall asleep at night. Firstly, you need to understand your emotional ups and downs and realize that this is a temporary state. It's important to maintain a positive and optimistic attitude when facing difficulties. Secondly, I suggest seeking help from a professional psychologist or counselor. They can provide effective psychological guidance and support to help you deal with your negative emotions and thoughts. Additionally, professional counselors can teach you relaxation and stress management techniques to help improve your insomnia. Furthermore, establishing a healthy lifestyle is also important. Try to maintain regular sleep schedules and avoid consuming caffeine or overeating before bedtime. Engage in relaxing activities such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to alleviate stress. Lastly, don't forget to share your feelings with family and friends. Communicating with them can make you feel supported and understood, and it can also help alleviate your burden. If you feel the situation is urgent or if you have thoughts of suicide or self-harm, please seek professional medical help immediately or call emergency services. You are not alone, and there are many people willing to lend a hand to help you through this difficult time.
**Vicuna-v1.5:** Hello, I'm sorry to hear about your situation where you feel sad during the day, happy at night, leading to insomnia. First of all, I want to express my apologies to you; insomnia can be very distressing. Regarding your thoughts of suicide during the day, I want to remind you that suicide is a very serious issue that can cause great harm to you and your family. If you have such thoughts, I suggest seeking professional psychological counseling or medical help immediately. Talking to a doctor or psychologist can provide you with effective methods to cope with anxiety and sadness, helping you gradually overcome them. As for the difficulty sleeping at night, I understand how uncomfortable that can be. I recommend trying relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or stretching exercises. If you find it hard to control your thoughts, you might try limiting your use of electronic devices, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime, starting from daytime. Lastly, I hope you can find ways that work for you to deal with negative emotions during the day and at night, gradually reclaiming a happy and peaceful life. If you have any further questions, feel free to consult me anytime, and I'll do my best to assist you.
**Chinese-Alpaca2:** Feeling sad during the day and happy at night, it's so strange. What should I do if I'm experiencing insomnia? Hello, the situation you described sounds very distressing. First of all, I want to tell you that you are not alone in experiencing this. Insomnia is a common psychological issue that many people go through. Regarding your situation, I understand that feeling sad during the day and happy at night might stem from inner conflicts and anxiety. The negative emotions during the day may leave you feeling down and helpless, while the nighttime happiness may bring confusion and unease. Insomnia could be one manifestation of your inner conflicts and anxiety. I suggest trying relaxation and stress-relief techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga. Additionally, adjusting your sleep schedule and maintaining regular sleep habits might be beneficial. If your insomnia persists, I recommend seeking help from a professional psychologist or counselor. They can provide you with deeper analysis and guidance to help you better cope with your inner conflicts and anxiety. I hope my suggestions are helpful to you. If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact me anytime.
**ChatGLM2:** Hello, thank you for reaching out to me. Your situation sounds quite complex. Feeling sad during the day and unable to sleep despite feeling happy at night could be indicative of unstable emotional fluctuations. You may need to explore your emotions and thoughts and try to find some methods to alleviate stress. You could try engaging in activities you enjoy or chatting with friends or family to share your feelings. If you feel you need more support, consider seeking help from a professional psychologist or counselor.

**Q3: A More Clear Description of the Contributions of the Paper**

**Ans:** Thank you for bringing up this point. We present the clearer description of our contribution here，and will address it accordingly in the next version. Existing benchmarks in the mental health domain, such as Mental-LLM [1], only focus on the model's ability to predict stress, suicide, and depression in online social media posts. Similarly, DialogueSafety [2] only assesses the safety of model outputs in emotional support tasks. In contrast, PsyEval comprehensively evaluates whether models possess sufficient knowledge in the mental health domain, sensitivity in diagnosing various complex scenarios, and the ability to provide emotional support. The design of these tasks fully considers the unique aspects of the mental health field, such as the subjectivity and ambiguity of symptom expression and comorbidities.

**Q1: Datasets Selection**

**Ans:** The choice of datasets for each task was carefully considered. For instance, the SMHD [1] dataset is currently the only one comprising a variety of complex psychological conditions found in online forum posts, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and comorbidity of multiple disorders, totaling ten different scenarios. However, datasets like Dreaddit [2] only cover stress, DepSeverity [3] only includes depression, and SDCNL [4] focuses solely on Suicide and Depression, thus lacking comprehensive coverage and failing to consider comorbidity of mental illnesses. Similarly, the selection of the D4 [5] dataset aligns with this principle, as it is currently the only dataset simulating medical-patient diagnostic scenarios in the mental health domain.

**Q2: Language Selection**

**Ans:** Thank you for your insightful comment. We share the same curiosity towards LLM performance on different langauges and are aware of the cutural differences behind mental health, hence we include different languages in PysEval. However, due to the limited availability of publicly accessible psychological counseling datasets with explicit annotations like PsyQA [1] in other languages, we lack comprehensive coverage. In the next version, we aim to address this by including more languages and fully considering the diversity that language brings.

**Q3: Details of Human Evaluators**

**Ans:** Regarding human evaluation, four human evaluators, aged between 20 and 24, consisting of three males and one female, with two from engineering backgrounds and two from medical backgrounds, scored responses from human counselors and six model responses, totaling 210 responses across 30 examples. The Fleiss' Kappa among the four human evaluators is illustrated in the figure below.

|               | Fluency | Coherence | Relevance | Helpfulness | Emo. | Int. | Exp. |
| ------------- | ------- | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Fleiss' Kappa | 0.88    | 0.81      | 0.72      | 0.72        | 0.74 | 0.72 | 0.73 |

**Q1: the Sample Size of the Datasets**

**Ans:** While the individual test sets for our tasks may be relatively small in scale, the total volume of all test sets amounts to 1610 instances. Nonetheless, it's worth noting that certain benchmark datasets, like ChemLLMBench [1], have even fewer samples, with only 800 data points. Additionally, the cost associated with invoking the GPT-4 API has somewhat constrained our ability to expand the size of the test sets. However, in the next version, we will consider enlarging the scale of the test sets.

**Q2: if We can Really Evaluate Mental Health Completely Without Human Intervention at Some Point**

**Ans:** While LLMs can assist in detecting an individual's mental state, the final evaluation of one's mental health should indeed be determined by a psychiatrist. Regarding the evaluation of consulting or emotional support results, it's crucial to consider the perspective and feedback of real visitors or patients. Ultimately, the effectiveness of treatment, which reflects an individual's improvement in mental state, should play a significant role in the overall assessment process.

**Q2: the Implications of Truly Randomly Sampling**

**Ans:** During the random sampling process, we aimed to maintain the label distribution of the data consistent with the original dataset. For instance, when using the D4 dataset, we strived to ensure that the labels for different severity levels of depression and suicide remained consistent with the original dataset. Additionally, the cost of invoking the GPT-4 API somewhat limited our ability to expand the size of the test set. However, in the next version, we will consider increasing the scale of the test set.

**Q4: IRB Review**

**Ans:** In this human evaluation, the four participants involved were from our institution. This experiment constituted a non-invasive study that did not involve any direct human contact. According to our institution's guidelines, such studies do not require rigorous ethical review. Furthermore, in this experiment, we ensured that the participants were not subjected to any adverse psychological effects, and their participation was voluntary. Some participants even expressed interest in participating in future tests. Therefore, we believe that this human evaluation does not require IRB review.
