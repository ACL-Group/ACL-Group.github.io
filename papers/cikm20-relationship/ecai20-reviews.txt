Abstract:	Interpersonal language style shifting in dialogues is an interesting and almost instinctive ability of humans. Understanding personal relationship from language content is also a crucial step toward further understanding dialogues. In this paper, we try to computationally infer relationship from short dialogue segments. First, we build a dataset of dyadic dialogue transcripts with categorical relationship labels from movie scripts. Then we identify and extract multiple lexical, syntactic and semantic features from the dialogues and propose a binary (family/workplace) classifier that achieves a prediction accuracy that is close to human performance. The identified indicative features, together with the dataset, will be useful for future sociolinguistic research.

From my perspective, this is an interesting and novel work. The authors develop an approach to identifying the type of relationship in a dyadic relationship from the dialogue itself. Human annotators aren't always even able to do this task, but to the extent that systems can be trained to do so at least as well, then it could be used for tuning support systems. It is beneficial that they simplified the task down to just work vs family, as the scheme was to nuanced and difficult for human annotators.

However, I hesitate the accept the paper based on the selection of the dataset. These dialogues from movies may not match real dialogues in work and home settings. People may say very different things when acting that they say in real life. The generalizability to another corpus is very concerning in this case. I believe this limitation greatly detracts from the quality of this work.

Moreover, I wonder if context is missing. For example, the differences between work and family may depend on where the conversations between co-workers and family members, respectively occur (ie bar vs. office, house vs. public), as well as the topics possibly. The work did not seem to take into account context, and therefor it is limited. However, to the extent that GIS can identify location, or for more immediate development goals, the system can automatically learn topic, this information can be fed into the system to moderate the prediction by context. Context should also be considered, then, in the training data from the dataset of movies.

The reported work aims at identifying personal relationship based on (narrative) dialogues with a claim that the method can generalize to real-world (non-scripted) dialogues. For the purpose of this research, personal relationships have been categorized into two dimensions: personal/family versus workplace/professional. The allocation of dialogues to either category is performed by logistic regression using a set of handcrafted features based on reference [31]. The dataset consists of 2770 training dialogues with an average number of turns 0f 8.44. The results are within reach of human classification and exceed some achieved with CNN or LSTM, although little detail is offered on the DL approaches.

The work is overall rather empirical in its approach to dialogue and linguistic aspects. It rests on the assumption that narrative dialogues are comparable to real-world dialogues, which is justified by a small number of references but might actually be called into question. Scripted dialogues are not natural dialogues and are influenced by clearly defined roles, movie genres and narrative functions in dialogue (persuasion, antagonism, relationship building ...). Their turn-taking might also differ from natural conversation as well. This distinction is clearly established when considering dialogue datasets for ML.
Serban, I.V., Lowe, R., Henderson, P., Charlin, L. and Pineau, J., 2018. A survey of available corpora for building data-driven dialogue systems: The journal version. Dialogue & Discourse, 9(1), pp.1-49.

The features selected appear both arbitrary and somehow obvious: address and levels of politeness and familiarity quite naturally map onto the predefined category and in that sense Table 1 does not uncover any counter-intuitive phenomena.
The annotation mechanism does not appear to follow best practice either with a very limited set of annotators.

The overall impression is that this 2-category classification is a fallback position from the original 13-class relationships. The problem here is that the authors might simply have uncovered trivial features (such as address, or BOW referring to family terms - the examples of Figure 4 being pretty informative in that sense) that readily differentiate between the two target category and for which logistic regression is appropriate enough - but this departs from ML work in dialogue.

This paper presents a number of contributions towards the automatic inferring of relationships in text dialogues. This is a novel problem and is quite relevant to ECAI.

Firstly, they create and introduce an interesting dataset based on film scripts and manual annotations; they describe a number of engineered features, including differential bag of words, LIWC features, addressing features, linguistic pattern features, and other statistics-based features on complexity and talkativeness. They then train a number of baseline models and compare them to a simple logistic regression using those features, which seems to outperform the baselines on the binary task of determining a workplace vs family relationship.

Overall the paper was very well written and easy to follow. The task is, to the best of my knowledge, novel, and this paper is a good initial attempt at exploring the classification of relationships from text. The dataset provided, in particular, will be a strong contribution to further explorations of this topic, if made available.

That being said, the approach is still quite preliminary. I was maybe a little disappointed that the authors did not also try the 13-class problem and here only examined the binary workplace vs family model. Further, the proposed classification models are barely described, and it is unclear to what extent the comparison between the LR model using engineered features and the "baseline" CNN and LSTM models is fair. I would strongly recommend the authors to describe these other models and the classification experiment in more detail.

Title:	Inferring Personal Relationships from Dyadic Dialogues
Authors:	Minxue Niu and Kenny Zhu
Text:	This paper is about identifying personal relationship based on (narrative) dialogues and indexing them into two categories: personal/family versus workplace/professional.
Two reviewers have expressed concerns on the choice of the dialogue dataset (film dialogues) and whether it actually captured real-world dialogue phenomena. The technical approach has also been deemed preliminary, in particular around the choice, definition and implementation of features and the possible lack of sufficient context.
In their response, the authors include further details on their technical implementations and argue that narrative dialogues can still be representative. Their justification on only using 2 categories, instead of the original 13 mentioned in the early sections of the paper, was however less convincing because it loses the connection with a social science framework.
