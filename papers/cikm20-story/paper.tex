\begin{abstract}
Predicting endings for narrative stories is a grand challenge for
machine commonsense reasoning. The task requires accurate representation of
the story semantics and structured logic knowledge. 
Pre-trained language models, such as BERT, made progress recently in
this task by exploiting spurious statistical patterns in the
test dataset, instead of ``understanding'' the stories per se.  
In this paper, we propose to improve the representation
of stories by first simplifying the sentences to some key concepts
and second modeling the latent relationship between the key ideas within the story.
Such enhanced sentence representation, when used with pre-trained language models, 
makes substantial gains in prediction accuracy on the popular Story
Cloze Test without utilizing the biased validation data.
