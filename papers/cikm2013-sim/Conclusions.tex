%Accurately computing semantic similarity between terms is a challenging task in the applications of text analytics and text understanding.
We presented a lightweight, effective approach for
semantic similarity between terms with any multi-word expression.
It uses an isA semantic network extracted from a large Web corpus
to provide contexts for the terms, employs a concept clustering algorithm
to disambiguate the senses of the input terms, and finally applies
a {\em max-max} similarity function to compute the similarity.
Extensive studies show that our clustering-based refined algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods as well
as our basic algorithm in terms of pearson correlation coefficient on word pairs and MWE pairs.
The method is efficient enough to be applied on large scale data sets.
%due to its lower time cost in the calculation of semantic similarity between terms.
In our future work, we will focus on how to learn a more
robust similarity function instead of a simple Max-Max similarity function, and how to introduce the supervised algorithms instead of clustering methods for higher Pearson Correlation Coefficients.
