\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
Phrase Sense Disambiguation is an important problem in
natural language processing.
In this paper, we show the possibility to use Wikipedia
as a reliable and comprehensive source to bootstrap a process that
disambiguates unlinked noun phrases
in Wikipedia articles and then use the obtained co-occurrence
information to disambiguate noun phrases in new documents,
a process known as wikification. This approach extends the original
term-level co-occurrence to concept/sense-level co-occurrence.
Our evaluation shows that the co-occurrence based wikification can achieve
high accuracy (about 82.58\% on F1) efficiently (over 1000 words per second)
using just 10,000 popular
Wikipedia articles and moderate computation resources.
