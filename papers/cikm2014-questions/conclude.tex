\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

We presented a multi-label classifier based on LDA which incorporates information provided in document title. The main idea is to expand the label choice for every word during the training phase, instead of being restricted solely by observed labels. Therefore we use the title information (we called \emph{qinfo}) to provide information on label dependencies in a certain degree. We demonstrated such incorporation could improve the classification results. However there remains much work to do. Currently we didn't specify the relation between the \emph{qinfo}-incurred distribution and the standard label distribution calculated by L-LDA but only followed the intuition that they are somehow related, therefore we could improve our algorithm by modeling their relations in a definite way and giving quantitative descriptions. This will be included in our future investigation.
