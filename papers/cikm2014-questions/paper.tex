\begin{abstract}
Multi-label classification is a very common problem in Machine Learning community. It requires given an instance the model should be able to generate corresponding labels according to the instance`s features. Meanwhile, topic model tries to understand the latent semantics of an observed document, which could be used to describe the similarity of documents, avoid the influences of polysemy or synonyms, or cluster documents in a meaningful way. Nowadays using topic model to do multi-label classification on documents gathers popularity gradually.

This paper attempts to tackle the labeling problem on online Question-Answer sites such as \emph{Stack Overflow}, and tries to establish a new model improving current efforts on adapting unsupervised topic model to supervised one. Specifically, this paper believed that the question documents in online QA sites should be modeled according to both its title and body but in a different way. And we proposed a new supervised topic model integrating the title information (called \emph{qinfo} in the corresponding context) and proved in certain conditions the new model could have better performances.
