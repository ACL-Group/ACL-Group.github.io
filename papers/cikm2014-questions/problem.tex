\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}

\noindent
Our problem could be defined in this way:

Given a set of documents $\boldsymbol{D}$ of size $N$, each of which contains words $\boldsymbol{w}^{(d)}$ and labels $\boldsymbol{L}^{(d)}$,  we'd like to train a model which given a new document $d_{new}$ without labels could predict its appropriate labels.
