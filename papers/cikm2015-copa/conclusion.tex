\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude} This paper proposes a novel framework of
deducing commonsense causality by automatically harvesting a network
(CausalNet) of causal-effect terms extracted from a large web corpus. 
CausalNet is the first (to the best of our
knowledge) automatic constructed graph-based
representation of commonsense causal knowledge base.
Such a network can achieve a high coverage including long-tailed causality
relations. We then implemented an algorithm for detecting events in
two input sentences and computing a causal strength between them.
Evaluation shows that such a framework is capable of outperforming
the previous best approach for solving the competitive SEMEVAL task
known as COPA, and also shows a great potential in solving other
related causality reasoning tasks.
