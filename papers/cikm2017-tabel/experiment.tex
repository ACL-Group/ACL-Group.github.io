\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:eval}



In this section, we evaluate our table linking system and compare with other previous works
on the cross-lingual task.
We first introduce the datasets and state-of-the-art systems used in our experiments,
and explain how to adapt a mono-lingual entity linker into our scenario.
We show the end-to-end results of all the systems, and perform ablation experiments to
investigate the importance of different components used in the whole task.
Finally, we discuss and analyze the errors in our system.
