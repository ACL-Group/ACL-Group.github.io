\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we focus on a new type of 3D bin packing problem, 
in which the objective is to minimize the surface area of the bin 
that can pack all items. Due to the complexity of the problem, 
it is very difficult to obtain optimal solution. If we use DNN to parameterize these decision processes similar to what does in heuristic, we can obtain a more powerful algorithm. %, similar to the performance boosted in \cite{Hu2017Solving}
%heuristic algorithms may have the problem of lack of generality. 
Therefore, we apply a multi-task 
selected learning based method to optimize the sequence and orientation of 
items to be packed. The model is trained and tested with a large number of real data. 
Experimental results show that the multi-task selected learning method outperforms 
both a well-designed, effective heuristic algorithm and the previous DRL-based 
method significantly. We also release a large-scale 3D bin packing order
dataset. 
%Our main contributions include: firstly, a large scale 3D Bin Packing order dataset 
%is proposed; secondly, intra-attention mechanism which items have already 
%been generated by the decoder is first used to solve the 
%combinatorial optimization problem; thirdly, the multi-task selected learning 
%technique are firstly applied in solving bin packing problem. 
In the future research, we will focus on investigation of more effective network architecture and training algorithm. In addition, integrating the selection of empty maximal space into the architecture of neural network is also worthy of study.
