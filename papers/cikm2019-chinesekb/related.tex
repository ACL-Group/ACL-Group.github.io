\section{Conclusion}	
\label{sec:conclusion}	
Our approach based on translation is an efficient and effective approach to alleviate the data imbalance problem for quick knowledge acquisition. Hopefully, these two translated datasets (\zhcon and \zhpro) we release could serve as a solid basis for the artificial intelligence research in Chinese. Future directions include: 1) construct other valuable Chinese resources via our approach such as FrameNet \cite{Baker_98}. 2) Based on \zhcon, conduct research on Chinese common sense reasoning.
