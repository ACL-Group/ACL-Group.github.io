We are sorry to inform you that the following submission was not selected by the program committee to appear at ACL 2019: 
Construction of Chinese Knowledge Graphs via Translation 

Especially in light of the record number of submissions, the selection process was very competitive. Due to time and space limitations, we could only choose a small number of the submitted papers to appear in the program. 

Our selection process was not based solely on the reviewers assessment and scores, but also on discussions among reviewers, careful assessment by Area Chairs and Senior Area Chairs, and our goal to assemble a varied, interesting and high quality program. 

While it can be very disappointing to receive a notification of rejection of a paper on which we have worked hard, please keep in mind that a rejection does not necessarily mean that your paper is not good enough. In many cases rejected papers are not quite ready for publication in an archival venue, but the next version may be, leading to significantly more impact on the field. We hope that the reivewers' comments will be useful to you in this regard. 

Our program committee and chairs worked hard to collect substantive feedback for each paper, and we hope that your paper finds success at another venue given the recommended changes. Reviewer comments are enclosed together with meta-reviews that summarise our final assessment of the paper.

Title: Construction of Chinese Knowledge Graphs via Translation
Authors: Haijun Zhang, Yang Li and Kenny Zhu

                            META-REVIEW
============================================================================ 

Comments: The paper describes a translation-based approach to creating or enriching Chinese knowledge graphs based on MIT's ConceptNet and Microsoft's Probase.  The technique yields a substantially expanded Chinese knowledge graph resource and
reflects a modest improvement over a baseline system.

The resulting Chinese KGs will be shared with the community, and a method for exploiting translation in creating multilingual knowledge graphs is developed.

The reviewers found the presentation of the methods unclear in places.  The paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the impact of the compared approaches, with examples where the approaches yield different results.

What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper describes the construction of a knowledge graph in Chinese using the translation of two graphs in English: MIT's ConceptNet and Microsoft's Probase.  While ConceptNet is multilingual, the Chinese part is very limited and Probase is English only. The authors argue that building equivalent graphs in Chinese would be too expensive. The authors noted that a word-to-word translation is not possible given the lack of context and exemplify it with the word date, either a fruit or a point in time. The authors then used two steps to carry out the translation:
1/ They created a very simple context by appending the content of two adjacent nodes with a separating comma before submitting it to Google translate.
2/ They created a Cartesian product of all the possible translations of the two source nodes in English and associated the target terms in Chinese with their embeddings. They then computed the cosine similarity of the pairs and ranked them. They kept the highest one.
I did not understand how the authors combined the two methods, maybe they only used the second one, but it is not completely clear from the text.
Once translated, the authors obtained a graph of 2 million edges from ConceptNet, much more than the original Chinese part of it, but much less than the number of edges in English: 32 millions. I am wondering why. The evaluation on a sample of 500 edges is quickly described, and again some clarification would be needed on what the authors call a direct translation. Is it the node translation without context?
The authors applied their technique to Probase too, which is a taxonomic knowledge base and evaluated it on 500 samples. The improvement over what the authors call direct translation is of 1.4%, which is not impressive. The authors also analyzed the coverage of their graph with regard to existing Chinese graphs. Surprisingly, there is nearly no overlap. This is an unexpected result that the authors should discuss.


Strengths: The authors describe a simple technique to translate a knowledge graph from English to Chinese. On their quick evaluation, the results seem decent although not good enough to be really usable to me.

Weaknesses: The paper is sometimes difficult to read and the authors are not consistent with the naming: A date (fruit) is sometimes called a date, sometimes a jujube as in lines 113-120. The techniques the designed are not well described and the authors should discuss their evaluation more thoroughly with a few examples of good and bad translations.

What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The paper with the title "Construction of Chinese Knowledge Graphs via Translation" propose a method to create a knowledge graphs using translation of available English knowledge graphs and word embeddings. The authors apply the method they suggest to create two large scale knowledge graphs. The evaluation of the knowledge graphs is performed in detail. The agreement scores between the human translators who evaluate the results adds additional insight into the quality. The detailed comparison with comparable knowledge bases is valuable.

Although the authors attempt not to be limited with relatively small number of web pages in Chinese by suggesting a new method, the method they propose is inherently limited by the original knowledge graphs that are translated, the translation tool they facilitate, and the corpora they use to create word embeddings. 

The paper could report more information about the number of MWE's that were translated and used without the adjustment step that uses word embeddings, quality of these translations, why do the MWE's are presented with their average word embeddings, and the vocabulary size of the word embeddings. 

It is not clear where do the 2.8% and 1.4% accuracy improvement comes from. A detailed analysis of what does the second step (adjusting using word embeddings) correct and wrong could help me to contextualize the results better.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reasons to accept
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- two large knowledge graphs are introduced
- a valuable contribution about utility of word embeddings for improving translations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reasons to reject
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- it is not clear where does the improvement comes from
- some decisions in the design sound arbitrary

What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper describes the construction of a Chinese knowledge graph starting from two similar dataset in English (ConceptNet and Probase), and translating the labels using Google Translate.
The resulting datasets are then manually evaluated on 500 random samples by two human annotators. Results show that the described system performs better than other similar automatic systems.

Strengths:
- Results show that the technique achieve good results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not include any new research idea for the area.

In the introduction, the authors say that it's difficult to obtain billions of Chinese web pages, while this is affordable with modern techniques.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reasons to accept
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The described method solves the described issue with good results.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Reasons to reject
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The paper does not include any new research idea for the area. The revision part (Section 2.2) consists in ranking pairs of words using cosine similarity, an old-fashioned idea that has been used extensively in building such resources in other languages.

Questions and Suggestions for the Author(s)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The description of the rules Google Translate use for translation (in the end of Section 1) is quite trivial. The new Google Translate engine uses also context, and I think that one can find a way to add it using the English version of the ontologies, just to have a better translation.
