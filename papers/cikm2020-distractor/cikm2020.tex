\begin{abstract}
  In this paper, we propose a novel configurable framework to automatically 
generate distractive choices for open-domain cloze-style multiple-choice questions. 
The framework incorporates a general-purpose knowledge base to 
  effectively create a small distractor candidate set, and a feature-rich learning-to-rank model 
to select distractors that are both plausible and reliable. 
Experimental results on a dataset across four domains show that 
our framework yields distractors outperforms previous methods both 
by automatic and human evaluation. 
The dataset can also be used as a benchmark for distractor generation research in future.
The framework has been successfully deployed in a English language learning and reading app 
available on all popular platforms since 2018.
