##1. Currently, the paper mentions that the relations in the test dataset are similar. How does the model perform when relations with varying degrees of complexity are included in the test dataset? #我觉得没有意义，如果要看test relations区别大的看few-rel就可以了，我们的dataset就是因为test set的relation share同样的entity才有现实意义
##2. How does the performance of context encoder change with an increase in sentence length? # 设置好maxlength就好了？
##3. When multiple relation types or multiple entity pairs are present in the input sentence, how does the performance change? # 如果multiple relations 在一个input sentence里面，performance会变差。我们的数据集里应该有这样的case。 discuss result的时候简单说一下（sample一些看result）

##* More details about the constructed dataset and the used cross-domain dataset, like the type of entities, information on the relation complexity/type, can help in drawing a parallel to other language datasets #介绍一下cross-domain dataset？但是文章里说了只要share同一种语言就可以

## * As the paper claims, the inclusion of cross-domain data significantly boosts the performance. It might be useful to check if the framework can handle zero-shot relation classification as well conclusion/future work



## How to split dataset is unclear. The first paragraph in Section 2 told the test set is split into support set and query set but did not mention whether training set is splited #definition里面training set时不用分support和query的，因为可以随便用。。而且在methodology里面讲过了从train里取support和test （definition里将一下无所谓split与否
##- It is confused what the class matching function F is and whether it is updated during training  # 可以举个例子比如k means或者一个linear classifier
##- The purpose of fast-slow learner scheme lacks explanation（给点background info）. And the termination condition of fast-slow learner is not mentioned. 

##In general, this paper is hard to follow. For example, the first paragraph in Section 2 gives a clear descrption of the problem formulation with some denotations. However, all these denotations are not used in the rest of this paper. We cannot get a clear framework on the input and output of the proposed algorithms, especially Algorithm 1.
## 可以把methodology里面可以用符号的加上符号 比如training set

##It is still not very clear on the definition of the "training data" in this study. Why are not the data for task enrichment considerred as training data? （Training data指indomain的data 讲清楚
