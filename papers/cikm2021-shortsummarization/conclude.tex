\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work,
we find that the semi-structured dataset is better than 
textual dataset and structured dataset for 
opinion summarization task.
We proposed a dual-encoder seq2seq model with opinion-aspect pair encoder and implicit sentence encoder, which can make full use of the semi-structured data.
The results showed that
the  semi-structured dataset training on our proposed model can generate better summaries.
