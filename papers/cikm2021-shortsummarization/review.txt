----------- Comments to the Author(s) -----------
* The writing has serious issues which make it difficult to follow along. It is often difficult to understand sentences due to word order inversion. It is rarely straightforward who does what. For example, "always ignores the sentences that cannot extract opinion-aspect pair", "we collect the sentences that cannot extract OAs from as the ISs", "The IS is the sentence
that cannot extract typical OAs from." How can sentences extract pairs? Other issues exist: missing articles ("ISs at same time"), typos ("matchs").
* The paper lacks a discussion of related work. There is neither a dedicated "Related Work" section nor is the related literature discussed throughout the paper.
* The Introduction relies heavily on Table 1 to argue for the proposed method but only manages to create a faulty generalization. A quantitative approach would be better suited for this argument.
* The definition of implicit sentences is vague: "The IS is the sentence that cannot extract typical OAs from." How can this be operationalized as it depends exclusively on the OA extraction method? Also, there is no argument or evidence for the usefulness of ISs besides the carefully crafted proof-by-example in the Introduction.
* Essential details are missing:
     - For TransBOI and TransMOI: How many transformer layers are in the encoder? How about the decoder? What is the hidden layer's width? Where does the transformer's dictionary come from? How do you know it is suitable for the task at hand? How wide is the LSTM's hidden representation? How many layers are in the LSTM? Is the LSTM single- or bi-directional? How can one train a transformer model from scratch on the multi-document summarization task and obtain a model that can generalize given so little data? Transformer models are notoriously data-hungry.
     - For BART-based models: What BART model was used in the experiments? There are large substantial differences even between the original four BART models.
* Many references mention editors for conference articles. This is incorrect. For example, [2] lists ACL 2020's program chairs as editors. For all ACL publications, the authoritative bibliographic data is available on the ACL Anthology https://aclanthology.org
----------- Summary -----------
The paper proposes semi-structured input for multi-review summarization. In this approach, several reviews are pre-processed to extract Opinion-Aspect pairs (OAs) and Implicit Sentences (IS). The two types of information are input to a seq2seq model that generates the text of a summary review. Unfortunately, implicit sentences are not adequately motivated, nor are they adequately defined. The paper is not ready for publication. There are issues with the writing, and the paper lacks essential details.

----------- Comments to the Author(s) -----------
The paper idea is well founded. But the technical merit of the paper is weak. It is comparative approach of two different DL approaches - with single and separate data inputs. The question that arises is why is DL required. It is feasible that traditional feature based approaches would also give similar results. The y-axis range and values are not well stated in the paper.

Why have you not compared your results with relevant papers such as[2]?
----------- Summary -----------
Not enough novelty and technical inquisitiveness for a short paper.

Summary:
The paper presents a semi-structured input consisting of all opinion-aspect pairs and implicit sentences extracted from a set of reviews. The proposed seq2seq model trained on semi-structured data outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on the Yelp and Amazon datasets.

Pros:
The research problem clearly formalized. The related work has been well presented and the added value of the proposed approach is discussed well. The methodology has its own merits and is well formalized. The evaluation is well presented and highlights that the semi-structured dataset training on the proposed model can generate better summaries.

Cons:
Although the proposed approach has its own merits, but the authors didn't provide details about how producing semi-structured summaries can generate more informative summaries than textual and structured summaries. From the figure, it is clear to me that they understand this issue, but there is no proper explanation in the text. Mainly authors tried to reduce a long paper, most probably, but failed to prepare a self-descriptive short paper version.
----------- Summary -----------
The paper is well written and easy to follow. The contribution of the paper will advance the state-of-the-art. The Presentation of the paper should be improved.
