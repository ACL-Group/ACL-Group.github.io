abstract = {Predicting endings for narrative stories is a grand challenge for machine commonsense reasoning. The task requires ac- curate representation of the story semantics and structured logic knowledge. Pre-trained language models, such as BERT, made progress recently in this task by exploiting spurious statistical patterns in the test dataset, instead of 'understanding' the stories per se. In this paper, we propose to improve the representation of stories by first simplifying the sentences to some key concepts and second modeling the latent relation- ship between the key ideas within the story. Such enhanced sentence representation, when used with pre-trained language models, makes substantial gains in prediction accuracy on the popular Story Cloze Test without utilizing the biased validation data.},

    abstract = {This paper introduces Task 2 of the DCASE2019 Challenge, titled "Audio tagging with noisy labels and minimal supervision". This task was hosted on the Kaggle platform as "Freesound Audio Tagging 2019". The task evaluates systems for multi-label audio tagging using a large set of noisy-labeled data, and a much smaller set of manually-labeled data, under a large vocabulary setting of 80 everyday sound classes. In addition, the proposed dataset poses an acoustic mismatch problem between the noisy train set and the test set due to the fact that they come from different web audio sources. This can correspond to a realistic scenario given by the difficulty in gathering large amounts of manually labeled data. We present the task setup, the FSDKaggle2019 dataset prepared for this scientific evaluation, and a baseline system consisting of a convolutional neural network. All these resources are freely available.}
