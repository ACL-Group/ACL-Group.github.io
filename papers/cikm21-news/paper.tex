\begin{abstract}

News recommendation for anonymous users is useful but challenging for many news portals, where interactions between users and articles are limited within a temporary login session. 
Previous works tend to formulate session-based recommendation as a next item prediction task, while they neglect the implicit feedback from user behaviors, which indicates what users really like or dislike. 
Hence, we propose a simple method to model user preferences from their positive feedback (i.e. the article they spend more time on) and negative feedback (i.e. the unclicked article in the impression list).
Empirical evaluation on three real-world news datasets shows promising performance of 
more accurate and diverse recommendations than other SOTA session-based recommendation approaches.

%Many online news platforms allow anonymous user login, and this set challenges for the existing news recommendation system to extract immediate interests of the user with limited implicit feedback information. This session-based recommendation  usually be modeled as next-item prediction task in recent work, but most of them regard click as positive feedback, ignoring other informative user behaviours.
%  When a user clicks an article, does this mean he really likes it? Does this mean he really doesn't like the others articles? These two questions encourage us to exploit user's refined positive/negative implicit feedback and to dig out user's deep intentions.
%  
% Some promising results have been recently achieved by formulating recommendation problem sequentially, and the usage of Deep Learning techniques such as RNN and multi-head attention transformer highlights their effectiveness in extracting sequential information. However, in news recommendation domain, article-cold-start problem and recommendation diversity need to be taken into account. In this paper we design time and context-aware session-based news recommendation methods that consider real scenes to produce the rich and user-interested recommendation list. 
  % As the positive implicit feedback, the interval that user stays for each article represents user's different preference, while the articles that user doesn't click in user's impression list pass more strong negative information than other articles. 
%We design a novel Implicit feedback based Time \& Content Aware Recommendation system (ITCAR), which leverages on the implicit feedback from user combined with temporal \& content information, trying to capture the hidden feature of within-session browsing behaviour. 

  % The temporal information contains click-level and session-levelinformation, trying to capture the feature of within-session brows-ing behaviour. The context of user interactions including article con-tent and session impression, is introduced to collect topic-orientedinterests.
