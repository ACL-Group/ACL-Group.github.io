\section{Conclusion and future work}
In this work, we address three challenges of Dynamic Multi-Domain Product Categorization for giant e-commerce platforms. 
To tackle with multiple evolving businesses,
% with domain-specific taxonomy classification tasks, 
We propose a sentence-matching-based unified \textit{Taxonomy-agnostic Label Retrieval (TaLR)} framework comprising of \textit{Retrieval-Reranking} stages. 
We exploit a bi-encoder BERT and a rule-based unit to ensure coarse-grained retrieval quality, and a cross-encoder BERT armed with contrastive learning for fine-grained reranking. 
Results under both single-domain and multi-domain conditions exhibit advantage of \textit{TaLR}, while it further shows generalizability on zero-shot scenarios.
% (Taxonomy evolving \& New taxonomy). 

For future works, we will deploy this system in product environment to test its online performance. To assure robustness, We shall also investigate contrastive learning modifications to alleviate the performance drop when node $divide$ happens. 
We may further integrate class incremental learning \cite{rebuffi2017icarl} approaches into our framework to accommodate incoming classes with extra data.
