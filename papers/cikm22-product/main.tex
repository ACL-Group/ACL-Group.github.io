%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
% Product categorization aims to tag a set of product titles with their corresponding categories from a large label set, which are usually structured into one certain taxonomy. With numerous sellers, when new products emerge, online shopping platforms have to categorize the products and recommend possible categories to their sellers to help them complete the product information and improve the user experience. However, platforms usually encounter different fine-grained business lines with frequently changing category labels, and this poses challenges for traditional classifiers which merely target a static taxonomy. To tackle this, we propose an unified taxonomy-agnostic classification framework with two stages: (1) \textit{Retrieve} the candidate labels from the whole set based on the semantic similarity; (2) \textit{Rerank} the candidate labels with contrastive information to get the final recommendation labels. We conduct a series of experiments to corroborate that our proposed framework not only alleviates the problems before but also achieves better accuracy and efficiency.
%It is typically formulated as a classification task using text attributes of products. 
%This poses challenges for traditional classifiers which merely target one static taxonomy. 
%We name it as Dynamic Multi-Domain Product Categorization (DMPC) problem. To tackle this, 
%It contains two stages: 
%(1) Two way \textit{Retrieval} stage with a vector-based component obtaining domain transferable ability and a ruled-based component bringing complementary information; (2) \textit{Reranking} stage capturing more precise text similarity. Contrastive learning is incorporated in our framework to further improve text representations. 

Product categorization aims at assigning a product with a suitable category from a large set of labels, usually organized in a predefined taxonomy.
This paper is concerned with a special but challenging scenario faced by large e-commerce platforms, which maintain many business lines with domain-specific category taxonomies, each of which evolves over time, sometimes very dynamically. 
We propose a two-stage taxonomy-agnostic label retrieval framework that relies solely on the semantic relatedness between 
the short product titles and category names in the taxonomies. 
Our comprehensive experiments show that this framework outperforms existing methods not only on static, multi-domain taxonomies but also on dynamically changing taxonomies.

% \section{Acknowledgments}

% Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
% individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
% preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
% section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
% document.

% This section has a special environment:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \begin{acks}
%   ...
%   \end{acks}
% \end{verbatim}
% so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \appendix
% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

% \section{Multi-language papers}

% Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
% titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
% rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
% English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
% every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
% main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
% additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
% the following command
% \begin{verbatim}
% \documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
%               language=french]{acmart}
% \end{verbatim}

% The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
% language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
% begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
% in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
% used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
% environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
% second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
% of their usage.

% \section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

% The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
% not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
% a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
% ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
% the margin:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
% \item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
% \item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
% \end{itemize}
