\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we take a step towards the practical utility of theoretical 
AL strategies. We experiment with AL strategies on various classifiers 
common in text classification and on multiple many-class short text datasets. 
We conclude the significance AL strategies on practical scenarios and 
that fastText is the best deep classifier best suited for AL.
Our work also shows that there is no best general sampling strategy 
suitable for all datasets and no clear correlation 
between the performance of AL and the dataset characteristics.
% A possible avenue for future work is to consider a more general problem setting 
% and come up with an approach which will generate consistent results on 
% both few-class and many-class classification tasks.
