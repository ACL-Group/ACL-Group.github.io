% \EVE{shall we change all the `method' to `strategy'?}
Active learning has been previously applied to few-class classification tasks
with success. This paper studies the effectiveness of active learning on
short-text classification with many classes which is presumably more difficult.
We apply the most popular query strategies plus some of our own
novel strategies with 4 commonly-used text classification models, 
namely fastText, CNN, LSTM and BERT, and evaluate them on a range of 
English and Chinese datasets. We discover that active learning 
works better on short-text classification with more classes and 
especially well with fastText which is simple to implement and more efficient. 
Our results provide a practical insight towards 
better understanding of interaction between active learning, 
the text classification model and the characteristics of task.   
%the increase of classes and different strategies. 
%We further propose a new query strategy along with frequency 
%adjustment feature which can be applied to earlier methods and 
%yields good results on many-class text classification.
