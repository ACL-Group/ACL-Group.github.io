\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

In this paper, we propose the word difficulty classification and word-pair difficulty ranking methods with multi-faceted features.
We discuss the performance of features on different languages and different corpora, the results show the robustness of our approach against different environments, which indicates that it is a promising method in word difficulty level prediction.
% which makes it easier in updating the vocabulary lists for different word difficulty level.
%We discuss the performance of features on different languages and different corpora, the results show the robustness of our approach against different environments of the same language which makes it easier in updating the vocabulary lists for different word difficulty level.
Our model with multi-faceted features is significantly better than previous methods with limited features.

%\JQ{this is a motivation, may be move to the first sentence of conclusion}

In the future, we will apply this method to more languages and try to figure out the most critical feature of different languages.
We will also explore the changes in word difficulty in different periods.
