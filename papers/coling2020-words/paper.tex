\begin{abstract}
  Vocabulary knowledge is essential for both native and foreign language 
  learning. Classifying words by their difficulty helps students develop
  better in different stages of their study and gives teachers the standard
  to adhere to when preparing tutorials and examinations.
  However, classifying word difficulty is 
  time-consuming and labor-intensive work. 
  % When the difficulty of a word changes with the social environment and the language environment, the work of updating the vocabulary is time consuming.\JQ{delete "When...consuming."}
  % Since the difficulty level of a word changes in different social and language environments, it is both time consuming and unachievable labor-intensive to offering vocabulary lists of different levels by experts.
  In this paper, we propose to classify and compare the word difficulty by analyzing the multi-faceted features 
  of words, including intra-word features, syntactic features and 
  semantic features.  The results on classification and ranking tasks show that our method is robust 
  against different language environments.
