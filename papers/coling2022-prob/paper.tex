\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recent work has identified that many natural language understanding and 
reasoning datasets contain statistical cues that
may be taken advantaged of by sophisticated models and hence overestimate the 
capability of these models. However, none of the work has been able to
easily pinpoint what these cues are.
%Some human-designed stress tests have been proposed to mitigate this problem
%but they are expensive to create and do not generalize to arbitrary
%models. 
We propose a light-weight framework to automatically identify possible biases
from any NLU-related multiple-choice datasets and further evaluate 
the robustness of any models targeting the datasets. 
%The framework is dataset and model independent. 
Additionally, it has
the potential of filtering given biased training data to help train 
a model with better reasoning power.
