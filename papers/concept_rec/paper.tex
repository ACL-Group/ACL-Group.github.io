\begin{abstract}
%Personalized recommender systems are becoming increasingly important to satisfy various shopping needs of consumers.
%They have been ubiquitous in a number of e-commerce platforms such as Alibaba and Amazon.
%\KZ{Inferring a concept behind user activities; explain recommendations.}
%Understanding latent user needs in their shopping behaviors is
%critical to industry recommender systems in e-commerce.
Recommendations made by modern e-commerce recommender systems are not driven
by user needs, and cannot explain the reason behind the decision.
%We believe, beneath the observable user behaviors such as clicks and 
%purchases, 
%\XS{Interpretability is one thing, another thing is novelty}
Representing implicit user needs explicitly as ``outdoor barbecue'' 
or ``keep warm for kids'' can further improve accuracy, novelty and interpretability
%offers great interpretability 
for recommender systems and ultimately leads to higher user satisfaction.
Backed by an e-commerce knowledge graph, 
%which is called \textbf{``E-commerce Concept Net''}, 
we propose a supervised learning algorithm to conceptualize user needs from 
their transaction history as ``concept'' nodes in the graph 
and then infer those concepts for each user
through a deep attentive model.
Offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our model,
and online industry strength tests show great advantages of such 
user needs understanding.
%Empowered by the e-commerce concept net,
%our solution might enlighten the next generation of e-commerce recommender systems.
