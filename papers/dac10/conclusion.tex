\section{Conclusion} 

A rapid, interactive, configurable and high-level IP synthesis system (RICH-IP)
was proposed. It offers a friendly front-end (based on SystemVerilog) and 
high levels of abstraction when designing complex IP cores. Its two-level
compiler allows users to interactively configure important design parameters 
in order to generate optimized cores that best suit the user's requirements.
We believe the system significantly simplifies IP design and 
performance tuning, and dramatically decreases time-to-market.
