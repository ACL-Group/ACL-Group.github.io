\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce an association knowledge-base, which could be used to help improve both the diversity and novelty of the recommendation result. The knowledge-base is built from three Chinese encyclopedia which contains more
than 10 million articles. Especially we built a person knowledge-base which could be used as a separate knowledge-source to facilitate client users. System demo illustrates our experimental results and it's application in real recommendation system. In the future, we will improve the knowledge-base by sense disambiguation and using topology information of the word network.
