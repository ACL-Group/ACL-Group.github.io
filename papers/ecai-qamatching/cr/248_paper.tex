\begin{abstract}
 Matching question-answer relations between two turns in conversations is not only 
the first step in analyzing dialogue structures, 
but also valuable for training dialogue systems. 
This paper presents a QA matching model considering both 
distance information and dialogue history by two simultaneous attention 
mechanisms called \textit{mutual attention}. 
Given scores computed by the trained model between each non-question 
turn with its candidate questions, a greedy matching strategy 
is used for final predictions. 
Because existing dialogue datasets such as the Ubuntu dataset are not 
suitable for the QA matching task, we further create a dataset with 
1,000 labeled dialogues and 
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art and 
other strong baselines, particularly for
matching long-distance QA pairs.
