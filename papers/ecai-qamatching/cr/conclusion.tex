\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we focus on identifying QA pairs in two-party multi-turn online dialogues based on turns with Q or NQ labels. Our proposed models achieve the best accuracy overall, and perform particularly well on LQAs. We also discuss the model decisions of using two attention mechanisms in a mutual way and the definition of history. Our future work will focus on more discourse relations in dialogues. Utilizing out-of-domain knowledge is another research direction for utterances matching task, especially for health-related dialogues.
