\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for clustering web images by 
their contexts. % as well as their visual signals.
The novelty lies in that our framework seeks to ``understand'' 
a context by converting words
and phrases in the context into high level concepts in an external knowledge
base such as Wikipedia. Moreover, it performs a tri-stage modified HAC 
algorithm utilizing information of various reliability.
%visual signals which helps when there isn't enough textual signals.
Our experiments show that on 40 ``ambiguous'' query terms, the purity, 
F-measure and NMI of our clustering results are
consistently better than other recently developed image clustering systems.
%and even better than Google Image search-by-subject feature in terms of
%diversity in number of distinct entities.
Our prototype system is practical as it is able to cluster a page of 
100 images within 1 second.
