\begin{abstract}
%Image clustering is an important technique in
%web image search and retrieval.
%Given a search term, 
Existing key-word based image search engines
return images whose title or immediate surrounding text contains the search
term as a keyword. When the search term is ambiguous and means
different things, the results often come in a mixed bag
of different entities.
%Even the ``sort by subject'' feature offered by
%well-known search engines distinguishes images only by the different
%historical query terms and not by the entity actually in the image.
%Existing image clustering techniques cannot distinguish images by the
%entities because they classify images using either their low level
%visual signals or the mere distribution of words in the text
%context.
This paper proposes a novel framework that understands
the context and thus infers the most likely entity in the given
image by disambiguating the terms in the context
into the corresponding concepts from external knowledge
in a process called conceptualization.
The images can subsequently be clustered by the most likely associated
entities. This approach outperforms the best competing
image clustering techniques by 29.2\% in NMI score.
In addition, the framework automatically
annotates each cluster of images by its key entities which
allows users to quickly identify the images they want.
