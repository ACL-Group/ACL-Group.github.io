\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We developed an NLI data augmentation method with noise generation methods.
The experiments showed
that pretrained neural models trained on our new datasets 
obtain a higher accuracy on most adversarial test data 
and are well-matched to the original test dataset. 
However, the improvement tended to be small on some tests,
which suggests that some types of inferences are intrinsically harder 
and the poor results are not largely due to the spurious features in the dataset.
For future work, our data augmentation can be
used for other tasks limited by spurious cues. 
%Additionally, it is interesting to
%verify the quality and contribution of a dataset
%which will be created by using our method on an
%automatically annotated and parsed corpus.
Further research will be directed to better
ways of de-biasing the dataset and other ways to improve general model robustness.
