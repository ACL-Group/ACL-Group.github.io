\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we investigate the spatial features in assisting classification of POI. We introduce several spatial features including the neighborhood analysis, nearest POIs analysis, distance to different kinds of POIs and check-in records comparison to other POIs in the same neighborhood. In order to prove the effectiveness of spatial features, we test their performance on dataset from Foursquare. We choose two cities, NewYork and Singapore, with different scales to test on features. We add spatial features on NAME feature we extracted from POI's name and BASE feature including user check-in analysis features introduced by Ye. et al's work. As for the feature combination selection, we first train a binary classifier on each combination for each category, and choose the best combination on tune set for each category. Then we apply the feature comination to test set. According to our experiment on spatial features, the result show improvements on both individual category and overall multi-label classification.
