\section{Name Feature}
Similarly with human guessing the category of POI, the first intuition we got from a POI is its name. We build NAME feature in a straight forward way. We break POI¡¯s name into words, we collect all the words, and filter out those showed up in only one POI. Then the words build up a dictionary, and NAME feature is binary representation of POI¡¯s name in the dictionary.
