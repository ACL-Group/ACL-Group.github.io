Clustering of images from search results can improve the user experience of
image search. Most of the existing systems use both 
visual features and surrounding texts as signals for clustering 
while this paper demonstrates the use of an external knowledge base
to make better sense out of the text signals in a prototype system called
CISC. Once we understand the semantics
of the text better, the result of the clustering is significantly improved.
In addition to clustering the images by their semantic entities,
our system can also conceptualize each image cluster into
a set of concepts to represent the meaning of the cluster.
