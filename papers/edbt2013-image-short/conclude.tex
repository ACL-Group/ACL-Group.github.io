\section{Conclusion}
We propose a tri-stage clustering algorithm with conceptualization for image search result.
The experimental result shows that our system is effective to be applied
to the image result clustering scenario. Also, we go one step further to conceptualize each
cluster to a set of concepts to show what the cluster is.
