\section{Introduction}
Group behavior in website has became more and more common.
Lots of users share a common account but behavior in their own preferences.
However, such group behavior is a disaster for recommendation system on website especially
for E-Commerce website. A family with an single AMAZON account but buy different types of book
is a typical example. The recommendation system will mislead by this group behavior.
It will recommendation wrong items to the user logining with this account or even reveal others users' private
interest to the current user.

Group behavior doesn't appear only in website but also in real life. Usually there is a supermarket shopping card
for a family. Family member brings this shopping card to supermarket and purchases his favorite goods.
Supermarket date center will record purchasing history for every shopping card for business intelligence propose.
However, the recorded history is generated by a group behavior which will lead to wrong recommendation
or influence the accurate of business analysis.

Another common group behavior generating scenario is watch TV. Usually TV is shared by family members.
The watching sequence comes from one person or multiply persons.For instance, after Dad has watched
news report, the son occupies the TV and begin watching Cartoon. The users switch is so smooth without
any explicit indication. Even worse, for some famous and interesting shows, the TV is watching by all
family members. The preference recorded in history thus becomes extremely noisy.
However, with the rapid development of digital television technology, TV watching sequence could be record by
large TV program provider and then becomes an extremely valuable data set which could be used for TV show
recommendation and census. But group behavior may significantly affect analysis process.

For database perspective, the records generated by group behavior are usually mixing with the normal record
in a single table. All records have an unique account ID. So after grouping by the account ID, all records
from a single account could be fetched. However, for data mining tasks, mining algorithms or mining experts
are interested in real users instead of account users because lots of algorithms and programs are real user based.
If the input records are from different users even with the same account ID, these algorithms and programs will
never work correctly. For example, the classification algorithms such as C4.5 and Maximum likelihood
will be dramatically influenced by different users with single account ID because these classification algorithms
will mislead by totally different user preferences.

And by our common sense, we know there isn't a guarantee that there is always an one-to-one correspondence between
account user and real user. Thus, splitting history record generated by group behavior will be significant to
scientific community.

However, there are no method to deal with history record generated by group behavior.
This is not only because the problem is easy to ignore but also the problem is hard to solve.
First of all, there are no explicit user switching signal in the sequence. For some observers,
They may never discover preference user switching unless we tell them. Secondly, we don't have
background knowledge about the users behind this sequence. That is, we don't know how many persons
they have and we don't have profiles for each of them. Thirdly, even for human observer, it's hard
to judge the preference switching is an appearance of a new user or a current user switching his
preference. Last but not least, we even don't have an explicit description for the items they touched.

In this paper, we propose an novel splitting algorithm which will split records generated by an account
to corresponding real users. The algorithm will not only tell how many real users hidden in the sequence
but also cluster the records to corresponding real users. The preliminary result shows that our splitting
algorithm works both efficiently and effectively. In TV watching sequences test, for some sequences our
algorithm achieves almost 90\% precision and the overall splitting precision is almost 70\%. On the other
hand, our algorithm works in $O(n^2)$ complexity which would be quite quick in modern person computer.
