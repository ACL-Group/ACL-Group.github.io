\begin{abstract} 
TV is usually watched by a group of people and TV program service provider collects viewing history
from a single TV. It's important and interesting to know how many persons is in front of TV and
who's watching the TV know. In this paper, we proposed a novel and efficient algorithm to
discover who's watching TV and how many persons in front of TV from TV watching sequence.
Experimental results show that our algorithm works efficient and effective.
