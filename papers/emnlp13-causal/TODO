// General

* Thoroughly checked the literature to find all competitors(all the papers that have cited Girju and Chang on Google Scholar)
* Implement the Girju approach on the noun pairs in WordNet. 
	- Too big to process, time consuming (About 200G+)
	- causal relation is too sparse to label (all 1000 random examples are non-causal, or we just use some instances we labeled before)
	- suspend
	
* Do the parsing and extraction of candidates

* Distinguish between cause and effect

* Develop a classifier for detecting events/phenomena

* Improve both the supervised and unsupervised algorithms to make them less sensitive to input data
