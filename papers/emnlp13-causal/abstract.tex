This paper aims to detect causal relations that exist between 
two events or phenomena represented by a pair of noun phrases.
We introduce four features for causal extraction, which leverage
both cue patterns and associativity between the two noun phrases. 
%The causal pairs are always correlated, but not all the correlated 
%pairs are causal. In order to use the causal association metrics 
%we extracted better, we also utilize the causal cue patterns proposed 
%in previous work. 
We then present two supervised methods and an unsupervised method that
utilize these features and show that they compare favorably against
two state-of-the-art approaches in causal noun-phrase extraction. 
Our best supervised approach achieves an F-1 score of 0.778, which
is 11.2 percent ahead of previous work.
