\section{Conclusion}

We utilize extracted causal association features to develop
both supervised and unsupervised models for extracting causation relations
between noun phrases. Our preliminary experiment shows their effectiveness
over features proposed in prior work. The combination of causal cue phrases
and the causal association metrics demonstrated significant advantages
in identifying the causal pairs. The results show that the supervised
logistic regression approach has the best performance, with an F-1 score
around 0.78. We compare our methods with the existing approaches
\cite{chang2006incremental,girju2003automatic} and shows an 11.2\% improvement
on the F-1 score. Our unsupervised version of the algorithm also
posts a moderate gain over the previous unsupervised approach.
