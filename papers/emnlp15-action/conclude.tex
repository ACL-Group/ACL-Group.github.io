\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
%In this paper, we present the action conceptualization
%problem which seeks to generalize the arguments
%(either object or subject)
%of a verb into a set of concepts drawn from
%a taxonomy with limited pairwise overlap among them.
%Each concept then denotes approximately the dictionary
%``sense'' of the verb.
We developed a data-driven approach that automatically
infers a set of argument concepts for a verb by abstracting from a large
number of argument instances parsed from raw text.
These argument concepts are human-readable and machine-computable,
and can be used to represent the meaning of the verb.
Our evaluation demonstrates that the concepts inferred are
accurate to the human judges and show good potential at
identifying correct arguments for verbs even though such
arguments have never been seen before. This work can also
be seen as mining predicate relations between abstract noun
concepts from a taxonomy. In future, the framework can be
extended to map a verb and its argument concepts (which
represents a meaning) into a noun concept, such as from
country-{\em invade}-country to ``war''. This will be
useful for computing text similarity between predicates and noun phrases.

%we can apply these concepts to enhance many applications
%such as verb similarity computation, verb clustering,
%verb argument identification and word sense disambiguation.
%Despite it's NP-hardness, the problem can be solved by
%an approximation algorithm using branch-and-bound principles.
%We applied the approach to Google syntactic N-gram data and
%obtained a comprehensive, human-readable, machine-computable
%lexicon for 10,116 common English
%verbs and verb phrases. This lexicon sits comfortably on the
%semantic spectrum between FrameNet,
%and instance-based dataset like ReVerb. It has better
%coverage but more refined semantics than FrameNet, and
%thus finds applications in a range of NLP applications.
%
%Our problem can be thought of as a
%variant of the class-based selectional preference.
%The difference
%is that we can control the semantic granularity of the
%generated concepts and the fact that they have limited overlaps
%means that our action concepts are closer to the dictionary
%``senses'' of the verb being analyzed.
%We have generated an action concept lexicon for
%3734 most popular verbs in English and showed that
%such a lexicon can be useful in a variety of NLP applications.
%These concepts cover most of the valid arguments
%in the input data and have small
%overlap with each other. We automatically generate
%such action concepts for 3734 most frequently used English verbs and
%showed that such a lexicon represent finer grained semantics of
%verbs, thus can be used in a variety of applications for
%understanding text and outperforms several well-known related approaches
%or lexicons. One possible future direction is to generate mappings
%from actions to noun concepts, such as from
%``\underline{play}/instrument'' to ``performance'' and from
%``country/\underline{invade}'' to ``war.''
