\subsection{Demo Setup}
\label{sec:preprocess}

We run our system on a set of 1770 common verbs\footnote{The inferred action concepts
of these verbs as well as other evaluation results can be found at
\url{http://202.120.38.146/ac}.}
We use Probase\cite{WuLWZ12} %and WordNet\cite{wordnet}
as the isA taxonomy.

All action instances we use in this work come
from a combination set of
{\em Verbargs} and {\em Triarcs} packages of Google syntactic N-gram
data\cite{goldberg2013,googlengram} (called Google for short).

The data set, which was extracted by parsing millions of books,
contains 2 billion ngrams with dependency labels.

From the dependency labels, we extract \pair{verb}{subject} and \pair{verb}{object}
from the dependency tree according to subject-verb dependency (nsubj,
agent) and object-verb dependency (dobj, nsubjpass). We also
detect the longest taxonomy-recognizable argument phrase from the
subtree rooted at the head word of the argument by a sliding
window.
%Since the dependency only specifies the head word of subject/object,
%to extract the whole subject/object phrase in the dependency tree, we
%retrieve the subtree rooted on the head word to construct a candidate
%subject/object phrase. In order to make use of the knowledge bases,
%the subject/object phrases should be recognized by Probase/WordNet.
%Thus, we use a sliding window on the candidate phrase to further
%extract the most probable (longest) Probase/WordNet term.
In the following experiments, we set the maximum overlap
constraint between two concepts to 0.2, and the number of concepts
$k$ from $\{5, 10, 15, 20\}$ to obtain action concepts in different granularities.
