The paper proposes a new framework to understand arguments for verbs. It points the limitation of previous efforts -- FrameNet, which has limited lexical coverage, bag-of-words approach, which is too fine grained, and selectional preferences approach. I think this is an interesting and worthwhile research problem.

The process to build a taxonomy seemed reasonable. However, I found the top k arguments per each verb approach unconvincing. K should be dependent on the type of verbs, and without methods to detect k for each verb, the system will be less useful. I think k should be the output of the system instead of input(or you could have given k derived from argument count from FrameNet or Propbank?)

They perform two kinds of evaluation. First, they select 50 verbs and ask human judges to annotate whether concept is correct abstraction of verb's argument. The experiment shows their approach performs consistently better than the selectional preferences, second they compare whether an object appeared with verb in a Wikipedia corpus is in the argument set for each approach.

I found the evaluation decent -- as this is a new task, coming up with a solid, concrete evaluation is not always straightforward. Nonetheless, it bothered me doing only <verb, object> evaluation at section 5.3 without justifying it, <verb, subject> should be added to future versions to strengthen the paper. Also, the evaluation set is quite small-- 50 verbs, which might be okay, but the conceptualization evaluation looks feasibly crowd sourced(5.2), and argument identification can be automatically evaluated. Also, evaluation does not consider any hypernym or synonym. For example, "play piano" is the gold set. If one has only "instrument" instead of "piano", then it will be marked as false, which felt a bit unfair.

Overall I enjoyed reading the paper, although left a bit unsure here and there.

This paper provides a framework to cluster the arguments of a verb into k-sets and link each set to a concept in WordNet and Probase. Manual judgments show this framework outperform SP in conceptualization. This is a decent work. However, I still have several questions as follows: 1)Entropy (Equ 3) and mutual information (Equ 4) are used to compute the quality of an argument, the author should explain the reason. 2)The statement “an argument that appears in more patterns has higher probability to be correct, and thus has higher quality.” (page 4 left column) is not convincing at all. I think some arguments match only one pattern also have higher probability to be correct. 3)The experimental results in Subsection 5.2 do not convince me too. Who are three human to judge the final reaults? How to provide a fair comparison (e.g., Mechanical Turk)? 4)Some parameters and terms are not explained clearly(e.g., weight L) 5)In Subsection 4.3, it assigns k concepts to the arguments of a verb. I ‘d like to know how to assign an argument to a concept? Besides, I think different verbs may have different numbers of argument sets. Why do you select a fixed number (e.g., 5, 10, 15 in page 6) for all verbs?

The paper is well written and clear, the problem is well defined. Previous work is well compared to this study.

I suggest to have an error analysis section for discussing more about the shortcomings of this approach.

A minor editing comment: some words are broken in a weird way, for example in the first column, verb is broken to ver- and b, or its is broken to it- and s. It would be great if you can fix it because it was very distracting to me.
