\section{Conclusion}
%This paper proposes to identify \lnear\ relation from literature text and
%construct a knowledge base of object pairs that would commonly appear near
%each other in real world. 
We create two benchmark datasets and present two baseline methods to solve 
the object co-location classification problem, and show 
that existing methods do not work as well on this task. 
We also discover that LSTM based model does not have significant edge over 
simpler SVM model. However, the normalization of the sentence representation
turns out to be useful. The models presented here can be 
improved because they cannot take advantage of large amount of training
data. Once this is solved, we will consider in future a bootstrapping framework
that dynamically updates the model as more positive facts are extracted and
used as training data.
