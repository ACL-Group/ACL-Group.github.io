\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We proposed a brand new active learning framework on a LSTM network, and evaluated it over a noisy E-commerce data set. Sate-of-the-art classification results have been achieved on the data set. We have shown that we can achieve acceptable results at a relatively early stage comparing with the original LSTM model trained on the whole data set. In future research, we will concentrate on reducing the training time by not retraining the total data each sampling.
