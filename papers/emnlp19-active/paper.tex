\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Neural deep learning models works well for sequential text data classification
problems, but they require massive training data which is expensive to obtain. In order to overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel active learning framework for short-text (Chinese) classification. We demonstrate results achieved on E-commerce data sets. The proposed framework has decreased the amount of labeled data to a great extent and also produced comparable results with the original LSTM classifiers trained on the whole data set. Moreover, results have also shown that our approach is better than conventional sampling methods as well as the state-of-the-art active learning methods designed for deep models.
