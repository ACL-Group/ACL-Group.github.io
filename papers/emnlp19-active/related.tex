The central process in active learning, selecting useful data conforming to certain criteria is called ``Query Strategy Frameworks" proposed in a survey  \cite{settles2009active}. There are in general three strategies to select data points: uncertainty based sampling like version space reduction \cite{cohn1994improving}, query-by-committee \cite{seung1992query} based sampling as well as expected model change such as ``expected gradient length""(EGL) \cite{settles2009active}. 

When it comes to active learning in deep models, it has been applied in several fancy models. In order to overcome the dilemma like cold start,  \cite{deng2018adversarial} has utilized an adversarial model instead of improving on previous uncertainty based methods.
