\begin{abstract}
Monolingual parallel corpus is crucial for training and evaluating text rewriting or paraphrasing models. Aligning parallel sentences between two large body of texts is a key step toward automatic construction of such parallel corpora. We propose a greedy alignment algorithm that makes use of strong unsupervised similarity measures. The algorithm aligns sentences with state-of-the-art accuracy while being more robust on corpora with special linguistic features. Using this alignment algorithm,  we automatically constructed a large English parallel corpus from various translated works of classic literature.
