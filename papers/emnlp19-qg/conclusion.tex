\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed to use syntactic features to help question generator. And we design two models to encode both sequential and structural information, one is the stack model and the other is parallel model. The experiments show that our tree2seq model outperforms seq2seq model across all evaluation metrics. Since the tree encoder is a separated modules, it could be used with other advanced modules to improve the performance.
