\begin{abstract}
Textual question generation is a task 
of generating meaningful questions about an input text with a key phrase. 
Much previous work focuses on neural models that treat the input text 
as a sequence of words. In this paper, we propose to view the text as 
both a sequence of words and a structure of syntactic components.
We develop a model that takes advantage of the parse tree of the text, 
and results show that this model outperforms the seq-to-seq model and basic tree-to-seq model
substantially.
