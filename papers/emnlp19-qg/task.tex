\section{Task Definition}
Given a parse tree $t$ of sentence and a key phrase $k$, our model aims to generate a relevant question $q$ based on the key phrase and its context in the sentence. Mathematically, this task is to find $\hat{q}$ that satisfies:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{q} = \underset{q}{\arg \max} P(q|t, k)
\end{eqnarray}
$q$ is a sequence of words with arbitrary length: $q = [w_1, w_2, ..., w_{|q|}]$. $k$ is also a sequence of words which appears exactly in the source sentence and should be the generated question's answer. $t$ is an arbitrary tree parsed from source sentence by Stanford Parser\footnote{https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/}.
