\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Predicting ending for narrative stories is a grand challenge for
machine commonsense reasoning. The task requires accurate representation of
the story semantics and logic structure.
We present a method that leverages the commonsense concept knowledge 
from ConceptNet to simplify
the story and model the latent relationship among the key ideas in the story.
This method achieves the best accuracy by large margin on the ROCStory
Cloze Test without using the biased validation data.
