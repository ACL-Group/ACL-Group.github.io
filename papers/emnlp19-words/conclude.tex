\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

In this paper, we propose a word difficulty classification method with multi-faceted features.
We discuss the performance of features on different languages and different corpora, the results show the robustness of our approach against different environments of the same language which makes it easier in updating the vocabulary lists for different word difficulty level.
Our feature engineering model is significantly better than previous  methods which only considered about limited features.

%\JQ{this is a motivation, may be move to the first sentence of conclusion}

In the future, we will apply this method to more languages and discuss the most critical feature of different languages.
We will also explore the changes in word difficulty in different periods.
