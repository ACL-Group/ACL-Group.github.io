%\KZ{abstract is too long now. No need to motivate so much. Put that in the intro.}
Vocabulary knowledge is essential for both native and foreign language 
learning. Classifying words by their difficulty helps students develop
better in different stages of their study and gives teachers the standard
to adhere to when preparing tutorials and examinations.
However, classifying word difficulty is 
	time consuming and labor-intensive work. 
%	When the difficulty of a word changes with the social environment and the language environment, the work of updating the vocabulary is time consuming.\JQ{delete "When...consuming."}
%	Since the difficulty level of a word changes in different social and language environments, it is both time consuming and unachievable labor-intensive to offering vocabulary lists of different levels by experts.
	In this paper, we propose to classify and predict the 
difficulty levels of vocabulary by analyzing the multi-faceted features 
of words, including morphological features, syntactic features and 
semantic features.  The result shows that our method is robust 
against different language environments.  
%	to update the critical words list of languages used by a small number of people. \JQ{I can't understand the last sentence} \SY{I'm not sure how to explain the result. Thinking T\_T}
