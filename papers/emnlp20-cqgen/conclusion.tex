\section{Conclusion}
We consider the possibilities of integrating CQs into practical use with the design of a writing assistant system for task-oriented writings. We then propose KPCNet to act as the backbone CQGen approach of the writing assistant. Human judgements showed that KPCNet is able to generate more specific questions and promote better group-level diversity. Oracle tests with ground truth keywords provided in keyword selection showed strong performance, indicating the great potential to be exploited from improving keyword prediction. Future works may include utilizing external knowledge to improve the keyword prediction, and solutions for the occasionally illogical generations.
