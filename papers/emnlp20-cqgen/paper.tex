\begin{abstract}
Task-oriented writings like product description on Amazon often suffers from the missing of important information. \textit{Clarification question generation} (CQGen) is a promising approach to help alleviate the problem, but no systematic design has been proposed to integrate this approach into practical use. We consider one such possibility: a writing assistant which shows the user a group of clarification questions (CQs) to help supplement missing information during writing. We further propose \textit{KPCNet}, which generates both specific and diverse questions with Keyword Prediction and Conditioning, to meet the requirement of such system. Automatic and human evaluation on 2 datasets (\texttt{Home \& Kitchen}, \texttt{Office}) showed that KPCNet can generate more specific questions and promote better group-level diversity than several competitive baselines.
