\begin{abstract}

Automatic commonsense knowledge extraction has always been a challenge compared to factual knowledge extraction. This paper investigates why typical relation extraction models that work reasonably well on factual knowledge extraction fail on commonsense relations and suggest concept polymorphism as a possible reasons. We propose a method to tackle concept polymorphism by finding the variants of a concept. Experimental results show that the expanded concept vocabulary leads to more sentences where the two concepts of a triple co-occur, which means more training data based on distant supervision for relation classification task, and thus improve performance of relation classification model.
