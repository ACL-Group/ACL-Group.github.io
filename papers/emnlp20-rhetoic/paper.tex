\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
In a consultational dialogue between an expert $E$ and a client $C$, $C$ may fail to
sufficiently describe their cases with $E$. At this point $E$ may need to ask additional
clarification questions to seek further information. In this paper, we propose the following
task for a free-style dialogue system: given a dialogue context, and $E$'s turn to respond,
determine if a clarification question needs to be asked, and if so, 
generate the question automatically. We create a large health consultation dialog dataset
and a labeled test set for this task. We also present some baseline
seq2seq deep neural models that achieve reasonable results.
