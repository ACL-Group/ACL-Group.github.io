\section{Conclusion}

% what did we do
In summary, our work describes a data driven approach of
relation schema inference.
By maximizing the support of both arguments simultaneously,
our system is able to generate human-readable type pairs for 
a binary relation from Open IE systems. 
% what is the result
Our experiments shows that the top ranked relation schemas for 
each relation are accurate according to human judges.
The proposed framework can be integrated with future Open IE systems.
% what's the future vision
%In the future, we are going to explore researches on question answering field, leveraging these
%type pair information to improve answer quality.
