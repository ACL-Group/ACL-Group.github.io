% model the selectional preference of ReVerb relations to FB taxonomy.
% model both left and right side, and combination.
% one relation can have several type pairs
% we need to make use of FB type hierarchy
% we need to talk about relation combining
This paper presents a framework to model the semantic representation
of binary relations produced by open information extraction systems.
% to Freebase type taxonomy.
% By inferring preferred types simultaneously on two arguments for one
% binary relation, RvSp shows the different interpretations of one binary
% relation, and rank these interpretations by preference score.
For each binary relation, we infer a set of preferred types on the two
arguments simultaneously,
and generate a ranked list of type pairs which we call schemas.
All inferred types are drawn from the Freebase type taxonomy,
which are human readable. Our system collects 171,168 binary
relations from ReVerb, and is able to produce
top-ranking relation schemas with a mean reciprocal rank of 0.337.
