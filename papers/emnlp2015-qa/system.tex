\section{System}

%In this section, we first give an overview of our system
%for relation schema inferring,
%then we present the detail of each step in the system.
%%\KZ{Avoid the name RvSp, just say the system, or our system. Replace all
%%specific mentions of Freebase by more generic notion. This is possible
%%given that you have done the formal problem definition.}

%\KZ{Redraw this figure as the three boxes in the middle turned out to be
%black in my version of PDF. Also, instead of naming ``ReVerb'' and ``Freebase''
%specifically, use generic terms like ``Open IE'' and ``Taxonomy''. We want
%this system to be general and not tied specifically to ReVerb or Freebase,
%though the actual implementation and eval are on ReVerb and Freebase. These
%we can say in the eval section.}

The workflow of our system is shown in Figure \figref{fig:workflow}.
% input: reverb relation, total 3 steps (2 sent)
The system takes Open IE relation tuples as the input,
then performs entity linking, relation grouping and schema ranking
to translate them into final ranked list of schemas.

% firstly, entity linking (3 sent)
{\bf(1) Entity Linking:}
Relation arguments are linked to entities in the knowledge base by
fuzzy string matching. Each entity in the knowledge base has a unique identifier.

% secondly, relation grouping (2 sent)
{\bf(2) Relation Grouping:}
Linked tuples sharing similar relation patterns are grouped together.
Besides, each group has a representative relation pattern, which is generated from all the patterns within the group.

% thirdly, simultaneously SP (3 sent)
% need to refine at the last sentence.
{\bf(3) Schema Ranking:}
For each linked tuple in one relation group, argument entities are transformed into types drawn from the knowledge base.
%The selectional association model considers both types simultaneously, and then produce a list of schemas for the relation group.
Then this procedure ranks type pairs (schemas) in terms of how much Open IE tuples a type pair can cover and how specific a type concept is.
