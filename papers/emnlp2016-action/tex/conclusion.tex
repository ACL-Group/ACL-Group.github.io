\section{conclusion}

In this paper we presented a retrieval based action conceptualization method.
It utilizes the description nature of news title for its content and could generate an
action-noun map which shows the most possible noun abstractions for a given action class.

The resulting action-noun map is able to generate an array of noun concepts that are abstractions for
a given action class. At the same time, it not only provides a knowledge structure meaningful to human readers,
but also is an augmentation to the existing ontology-based Knowledge Graph such as Probase, and can help solve many
challenging problems in Natural language processing.

The potential applications of our conceptualization vary from semantic web search, QA system to
verb sense disambiguation. As a showcase we implemented a news search engine enabling semantic search for
action related queries. In a manually created evaluation dataset our method was able to outperform a TF-IDF
baseline and a Topic model baseline using LDA.
