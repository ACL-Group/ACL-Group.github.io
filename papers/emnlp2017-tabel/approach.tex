\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
In this section, we discuss how a mention in Web table is mapped to an entity in KB. Given a Web table in language $A$ and a KB in language $B$, we firstly generate a list of candidate entities in language $B$ for each mention, then find the target entity among them. Due to the language gap and characteristic of tables, we propose a jointly modeling framework using nerual networks.
