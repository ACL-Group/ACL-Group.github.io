\begin{definition}
A {\em Web table} is a tuple $\langle R, C, M, L_1\rangle$, where:
$R$ is the number of table rows; 
$C$ is the number of table columns;
$M$ is a list of cell mentions with the form $(i, j, m)$ where $i\in\left[0, R\right)$, $j\in\left[0, C\right)$ and $m$ is the string mention (allows to be empty).
$L_1$ is the language in which Web table is written.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
A {\em Knowledge Base} is a tuple $\langle E, P, I, L_2\rangle$, where:
$E$ is a finite set of all entities in $KB$;
$P$ is a finite set of all predicate names in $KB$;
$I$ is a finite set of predicate instances with the form $p(e_1, e_2)$ where $e_1, e_2 \in E$ and $p \in P$.
$L_2$ is the language in which $KB$ is written.
\end{definition}

Cross lingual table linking is to link every possible mention of Web table in one language to the corresponding entities in KB written in another language. \XS{Use above defs! }
