\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, 
we attempt to solve the real-world slot filling task 
in a novel Chinese E-commerce shopping guide assistant. 
We proposed a deep multi-task sequence learning framework with 
cascade and residual connection. 
Our model achieves comparable results with 
several state-of-the-art models on the common slot filling dataset ATIS. 
On our released real-world Chinese E-commerce dataset ECSGA, 
our proposed model DCMTL also achieves best F1 score comparing 
to several strong baselines. 

%\KZ{I think one of the most important contributions is the release of the
%taobao slot filling data set. However, this data set have to be high quality.
%Maybe you can sample some to get human to examine it and give an human/machine correlation score. If the quality is indeed high, u %should def claim this as
%a major contribution in the intro.}
