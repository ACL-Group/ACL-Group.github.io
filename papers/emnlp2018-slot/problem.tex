\section{Problem}
\label{sec:problem}
Given an utterance containing a sequence of
words\footnote{We use ``word'' in problem and model description,
	but ``word'' actually means Chinese char in our problem.} 
$\textbf{w} = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_T)$,
the goal of our problem
is to find a sequence of slot labels $\hat{\textbf{y}} = (y_1, y_2, ..., y_T)$, 
one for each word in the utterance, such that:
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{\textbf{y}} = \mathop{\arg\max}_{\textbf{y}}P(\textbf{y}|\textbf{w}).
\end{equation*}

In this paper we only define a slot filling problem in Dress category domain for simplification.
That means we know in advance the defined category classification (intent).
%Situation will get extremely complicated when we cannot get category classification and do slot filling from scratch.
There are thousands of category classifications in E-commerce domain
and in each category, there can be dozens of properties that 
are totally different.  Performing slot filling with tens of thousands 
slot labels with cross-domains is impractical at this point.
A joint model for category classification and slot filling is 
our future research.

Along with Property Key (\textbf{PK}), Category (\textbf{CG}) and \textbf{O},
there are altogether 29 (57 in the IOB scheme) slot labels in our problem. 
Examples are listed in \tabref{slot-labels}.
Notice that terms such as ``\emph{brand}'', ``\emph{color}''
appearing in an utterance
will be labeled as \textbf{PK},
while \textbf{Color} and \textbf{Brand} can be pre-defined slot labels
and will be assigned to terms like
``\emph{black}'' and ``\emph{Nike}''.

%Compared to the most well-known dialog state tracking challenge (DSTC) dataset,
%in which there are only 9 slot labels in DSTC1\footnote{\url{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/dstc/}} for bus booking scenario
%and 8 slot labels in DSTC2\footnote{\url{http://camdial.org/~mh521/dstc/}} for restaurant booking scenario,
%the dataset in our problem has larger amount of slot labels.
%Therefore, we call our problem as \emph{Large Scaled Slot Filling} problem.
