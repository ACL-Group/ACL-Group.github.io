\section{Supplemental Material}
\label{sec:appendix}

In this supplementary material, we add additional details supporting the experimental results and case studies.

\subsection{Experimental Results for Ablation tests}

Table \ref{tab:app1} shows the overall performance of four ablations and our full model (HDM). According to the T-test results among three runs, the precision between each two models are not significant different while the recall varies a lot. The full model gets the highest recall and F1-score among all models.

\begin{table}[h]
	\small

	\begin{tabular}{p{1cm}<{\centering}p{1cm}<{\centering}ccc}
		\toprule[1.5pt]
		Models &P&R& F1\\
		\midrule[1pt]
		QH&77.54&71.80&74.56\\
		AH&77.50&70.52&73.84\\

		\bottomrule[1.5pt]
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{The end-to-end performance of ablation tests.}
	\label{tab:app1}
\end{table}

Results in Table \ref{tab:app2} reveal that HDM model outperforms the ablations on matching LQAs. QH and AH perform well on SQAs while fail on LQAs. NON and ID sacrifice the accuracy on SQAs a little and make improvements on LQAs. It seems that when the history information is not quite concise and useful, the distance will play an important role on the final results. Besides, improving the accuracy on LQAs always shows a decline of the accuracy on SQAs, which shows the importance of the trade-off between the distance and history features. Although our full model provides a good result on overall performance, how to take better advantage of these two factors is still a challenge.

\end{table}

\subsection{Example Outputs}

To get a better understanding of the behavior of our models, we include two example outputs in Table \ref{tab:case1}. Both of the cases contain the LQAs with SQAs. The first example is a case where both HYD and HDM predicts QA relations better than RPN. While the second one is a case where both our full model (HDM) and RPN fail, HTY performs best in LQA predictions. As for SQAs, all of the models perform well. However, the DIS model is obviously not capable of matching LQA pairs. It also shows that the distance information sometimes hurts the performance of HDM on matching LQA pairs.
