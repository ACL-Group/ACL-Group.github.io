\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we focus on identifying QA pairs in two-party multi-turn online dialogues based on turns with Q or NQ labels. Our proposed models achieve the best overall and specifically performs well on LQAs. We also discuss the model decisions of using two attention mechanisms in an mutual way and the definition of history. In the future, we are going to focus more on LQA matching, especially the incremental cases. Taking domain outside knowledge into consideration is another research direction for utterances matching task, especially for medical dialogues.
