Review #1
What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
The paper proposes a method for question-answer matching in online discussions. The paper focused in two-party multi-turn dialogues and proposed a method for matching each question to one or more turns representing the answer to this question. The method is tested on a 1000 dialogues collected from a Chinese medical discussion forum.
Reasons to accept
The paper studies an interesting application. The methods are described in detail and the results are encouraging.
Reasons to reject
There are a few areas for improvement for the paper:
The dataset: the paper constructs and uses a new dataset based on online discussions in a Chinese medical discussion forum. There are have been other datasets that have been commonly used for this task. Specifically, the IRC dataset from Elsner & Charniak, 2008 and the Reddit dataset from Jiang et al., 2018. While creating an additional dataset is useful, it is important to also report results on existing datasets. This will test how general the proposed methods are and also provide an easy way to compare results to existing work.

Evaluation: The paper described multiple experiments for evaluating the proposed methods. The dataset seems to have a majority of cases where the distance between the question and answer is 1-2. This is not the best setup to test the proposed methods and it results in any distance based methods/features to perform very well. It would be useful to have an evaluation setup where the distance between the question and answer are at least more than 2

Related Work: the paper does a good job covering related work in the same application area. There are is a lot of other related work in question-answer matching in community question answering forums that is also relevant (especially from the methodology perspective) and it should be discussed.

The method: while the paper does a decent job with providing the details of the proposed method, it is sometimes hard to follow. The clarity of the description could be improved. Additionally providing intuition or explanation behind the method design choices could be very helpful


Review #2
What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
This paper proposes an approach to match questions and their answers in a dialog retrieved from online forums. They exploit the attention mechanism in their solution in order to capture the history between question and answer. They also constructed a new dataset which can be useful for further research on this problem. They outperformed other some prior work. These contributions are strengths of the paper. One thing I wonder is the running time performance of the system since it uses multiple attention mechanisms.
Reasons to accept
This is a well written paper. The authors gave some motivation towards their proposed ideas which made it easier to understand. Their experimentation seemed valid. They also performed an ablation study which provided more insight.
Reasons to reject
I don't think of any good strong reason. The only thing is that maybe this paper is very much specific to a task and won't be useful to general audience for future reference. Can authors think of any other similar tasks such that this proposed approach can be useful.
Questions for the Author(s)
You created a new dataset to show that your approach can work with long distance relationships. Can't you use the other datasets (like the Lowe et al 2015) just to show that your proposed solution can also outperform in other datasets as well. One thing that would make this paper stronger is to see outperforming results from a different dataset. Maybe you could have collected data from another sourc eas well. Just to show that the proposed approach is generally working across different data collections and domains.


Review #3
What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
The paper presents a system that matches questions and answers in two-party multi-turn dialogues. They construct a new dataset for long-distance QAs, from online health forum, and they test this dataset in an experimental framework. The QA matching problem is a difficult task that some previous works have tried to solve.
They obtain a relevant result on long-distance QAs.

Reasons to accept
The problem definition is well resolved. They have generated a new dataset, although there are not too many details about its validity.
Reasons to reject
The attention-based neural network model used is not new. By generating their own dataset and experiments on this dataset, the results cannot be compared with those of the rest of the research community. In the overall performance, they only compared the results of their models, but they do not analyze or compare the results with those obtained by people. It's pretty strange that the second to last section is related work.
