\begin{abstract}

Aspect-based question-answer pairs generation aims at generating the 
meaningful and interesting question-answer pairs from a context and 
a specific angle. 
This is a brand new problem and no existing methods or datasets are designed specifically for this problem. 
%This problem is particularly useful for automatically generating
%QA pairs from large number of documents. 
In this paper, we create a new aspect-based QA dataset for this task and propose
two methods.
% to generate aspect-based question-answer pairs.
%One is the three-step pipeline framework consists of paragraph retrieval, answer extraction and question generation,
%and the other is the filtering framework which remains the QA pairs relevant to aspect keywords after generation.
One is Filtering Method consisting of answer extraction, question generation and a filter to remove irrelevant generated results, 
and the other is Aspect-based Method which encodes the information of aspect into question generation.
%We demonstrate that aspect can guide to generate the QA pairs to show some point of view.
The Aspect-based Method well integrates the aspect into models and outperforms the Filtering Method on our test set through both automatic evaluation and human evaluation.
