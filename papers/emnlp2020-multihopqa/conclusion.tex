\section{Conclusion}
We propose RF, a new interpretable graph-based method for multi-hop reading comprehension across multiple documents, which delivers competitive results on WikiHop. More importantly, in addition to the predicted answer, we illustrate in our analysis how RF can explain its reasoning through explicit paths with fine-grained semantics by direct on-graph decoding.
