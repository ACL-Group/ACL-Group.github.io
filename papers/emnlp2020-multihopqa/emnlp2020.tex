\begin{abstract}
%\KZ{Quickly come up with your 4-sentence thingy. As for the title: shall we focus on the ``fine-grained''
%part or the ``multi-level granularity'' part? I think multi-level is a bit confusing.
%When you improve on prev methods the only natural thing is to ``add'' fine-grained things to
%the path, and not ditch the coarse grained things that was good. So our work should be
%progressive and not disruptive.}
Multi-hop reading comprehension requires deep understanding of relationships 
between multiple documents and query. In this work, we propose 
Reasoning Flow~(RF), a novel interpretable graph-based multi-hop model 
that abstracts unstructured textual information present in documents 
and query into a relational graph with fine-grained semantics. 
We introduce a noval collaborative graph representation learning mechanism 
along with a path decoding module to allow for end-to-end learning 
in training phase and reasoning path recovery in inference phase. 
Experimental evaluation shows that RF is able to explain its prediction 
in the form of explicit paths that are shown to be reasonable by 
human evaluation while achieving competitive or better QA accuracies over 
strong baselines on WikiHop.
