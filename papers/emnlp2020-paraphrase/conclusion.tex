\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for unsupervised paraphrase generation that outperforms most existing unsupervised methods and supervised methods with domain adaptation. While the results are positive, there still remains many problems to be studied. Can we find more underlying semantics? Is there a better evaluation metric than iBLEU? We plan to look into these questions in the future and generate better paraphrases.
