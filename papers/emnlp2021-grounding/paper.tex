\begin{abstract}
While pretrained language models have conferred substantial improvements on a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks, recent studies have shown that incorporating visual supervision alongside linguistic context brings additional benefit. In this paper, we investigate \textbf{A}dapter-based \textbf{V}isual \textbf{G}rounding~(\textbf{AVG}), which embeds visual features into a lightweight adapter module alongside the text encoder. AVG leaves the text encoder untouched during grounding phase, thereby making it more efficient to train. We also show that AVG outperforms vanilla pretrained language models and competitive vision-enhanced models on multiple pure-language tasks that require grounded inference.
