What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
This paper focuses on the "short circuit", that some neural models can make a correct choice without referring to the context of the choices in the questions. Their method can effectively detect such behavior in any model and can be further used to augment training data to teach the existing models to overcome short circuit problems. They conclude that the instability of the model is a common problem, and one of the most likely reasons is the short circuit.
strengths: The question is interesting and valuable. And also sufficient experiments.

weaknessesï¼šThe solution is neither convincing nor elegant and lacks academic value. They use the stress test to evaluate the fragility of models. Just as the authors claim that the "short circuit" is a specific type of model fragility, so even models get poor performance on the stress test, you can attribute this result to the "short circuit". It seems like this paper is about some common adversarial attacks and adversarial training wrapped with the "short circuit".

Reasons to accept
The question is interesting and valuable. The exploration of this direction should be encouraged.
Reasons to reject
1.The solution lacks novelty and academic value. 2. Many typos. Need attentive proofreading.

Review #2
What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
The paper introduces a new method to test whether Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) models leverage shortcuts on a specific sample to conduct prediction. The method is targeted at MCQ, regarding the right Answer of q1 (A1) as the wrong answer of q2. If the model chooses A1, which is not the right answer of q2, then the model short-circuits on the sample. The method is insightful and can inspire other task shortcut detection.
Reasons to accept
1.well writing 2.simple but effective method 3.adequate analysis
Reasons to reject
1.the swapping strategy may lead some sample error
Questions for the Author(s)
1.Maybe the right answer of q2 is also the right answer of q1, do you consider this situation?

Review #3
What is this paper about, what contributions does it make, and what are the main strengths and weaknesses?
The paper defines and investigates the "short-circuit" problem in the multiple-choice problems where neural models can make a correct choice without referring to the context of the choices in the questions with two black-box testing operations. Experiments on three NL reasoning models and four datasets show that the proposed testing operations could further augment the training set and alleviate the short-circuit problem.
Reasons to accept
The proposed stress operations are novel, well-motivated, and could be further leveraged for data augmentation methods that benefit the testing performance of the model;
Reasons to reject
It is a bit unclear how these stress operations or the defined problem could benefit the overall performance of interoperability of the original model performance and how different model size/model architecture could lead to different testing/performance results.
Questions for the Author(s)
Could the authors explain more about how human evaluation of the "short-circuit" problem could correlate with the proposed stress testing operations? Are there more explaination for why +crossover-based augmentation could benefit more for the different testing performance of the model, and could it help the original task performance?
