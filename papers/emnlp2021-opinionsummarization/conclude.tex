\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work,
we propose a data creation method to generate
 a semi-structured sythetic training dataset for 
opinion summarization problem,
which is known for lacking training data.
\cut{We showed that by extracting aspect-opinion pairs and 
implicit sentences from multiple reviews
first and then synthesizing them into semi-structured data, we achieve
better performance on opinion summarization.}
%\KZ{It is critical to show in your experiments that the proposed
%synthetic data is better than other possible alternatives.}
For this dataset, 
we designed an aspect guided model with opinion-aspect pair encoder and implicit sentence encoder.
The results showed that
the proposed model can make full use of semi-structured dataset
and generate high quality summaries.
