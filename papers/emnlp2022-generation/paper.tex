%Natural language generation has achieved great success with autoregressive language models. The training objective is maximizing the likelihood of output given the input from beginning to end. However, predicting the whole output sequence is quite tough at the start of training iterations. Inspired by curriculum learning that training models from easy to 
Curriculum learning has shown promising improvements in multiple domains by 
training machine learning models from easy samples to hard ones. 
Previous works which either design rules or train models for scoring the difficulty 
highly rely on task-specific expertise, and cannot generalize. Inspired by the ``easy-to-hard'' 
intuition, we propose to do in-sample curriculum learning for natural language generation tasks. 
Our learning strategy starts training the model to generate the last few words, i.e., 
do sequence completion, and gradually extends to generate the whole output sequence.
Comprehensive experiments show that it generalizes well to different % generation 
tasks and achieves significant improvements over strong baselines.
