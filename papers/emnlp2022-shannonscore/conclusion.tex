\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we improved the current state-of-the-art algorithm for reference-less evaluation of summarization, the Shannon Score by training a Decision Tree Regression model using Shannon Score and compression ratio as the features, and the human annotations scores as labels. Our experiments showed that the model produces an output that highly correlates with human annotations scores on both the SummEval datasets and TAC datasets.
