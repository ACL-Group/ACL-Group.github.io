\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we investigated the capacity of ChatGPT to serve as the underlying technology for developing chatbots that can simulate psychiatrists and patients with depressive disorder, respectively. To ensure the validity of our approach, we collaborated with professional psychiatrists who provided their expertise throughout the study. With their guidance, we developed a comprehensive evaluation framework that takes into account the distinctive characteristics of diagnostic conversations within the mental health domain. We then evaluated the performance of these chatbots and observed how varying designs can influence chatbot behavior, which provides valuable insights for future studies in this area.
