\section{Ethical Statement}
\label{sec:ethics}

Our study adheres to the ethical requirements in place, and we make every effort to protect the privacy and respect the willingness of our participants.

During participant recruitment, we required patients to read and sign an informed consent form. This ensured that they understood the objectives of the entire project, the research content, potential risks and benefits, and the purpose of data collection. Only after their agreement and signature were obtained, the evaluation process officially commenced. We also assured them that they could voluntarily withdraw from the study at any stage.

In order to safeguard the privacy of our participants, we took measures to anonymize the collected dialogue history. This was done by replacing usernames with random identifiers, ensuring that any information that could identify individuals was excluded from our research process. Additionally, we conducted thorough manual filtering of the dialogue histories to eliminate any offensive content or language that may encourage self-harm or suicide.
