\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we tackle the challenge of detecting multiple mental diseases simultaneously in the scenario of comorbidity, and propose a multiple MDD framework achieving SOTA performance in both binary and multi-label settings. 
We first apply risky post screening based on symptoms, providing reliable diagnostic basis for further disease detection. Then, we propose a two-stream Psychiatric Experts Model with a shared hierarchical encoder and disease-specific attention layers, which simultaneously process the symptom and text features to combine the advantage of both modality. We also explore the interpretability of PsyEx by providing a user-level analysis, and measuring the global symptom contribution to the detection of different diseases.
