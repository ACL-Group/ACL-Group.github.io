Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
The authors presented a new approach towards the Mental Disorder Detection task. They presented a thorough experimental analysis and showed the superiority of their own approach.

Reasons To Accept:
The approach using two stream psychiatric experts is novel. A detailed experimental analysis was presented. The results seem to improve upon the SOTA models.

Reasons To Reject:
Multiple SOTA task fine-tuned models were not included in the experiments (i.e. Mental-BERT, Depression-RoBERTa).

Questions For The Authors:
How the task fine-tuned models perform in this scenario? Do they outperform your approach?

Soundness: 4: Strong: This study provides sufficient support for all of its claims/arguments.
Excitement: 3: Ambivalent: It has merits (e.g., it reports state-of-the-art results, the idea is nice), but there are key weaknesses (e.g., it describes incremental work), and it can significantly benefit from another round of revision. However, I won't object to accepting it if my co-reviewers champion it.
Reproducibility: 3: Could reproduce the results with some difficulty. The settings of parameters are underspecified or subjectively determined; the training/evaluation data are not widely available.
Ethical Concerns: No
Reviewer Confidence: 4: Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings.



Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
Authors propose a model to detect multiple mental disorders from social media (reddit) posts. They use two streams of learning that should understand if the post is involving a symptom related to one of the diseases and if the post is risky (ie. relevant to the mental health) or not. Mental health comorbidities are common and there is not much work on detecting multiple diseases that person can have in the same time, while that is pretty common in practice. Authors use hierarchical network to learn post embedding in the lower level and then user embedding given all relevant user posts. According to evaluation, the proposed model performs better than strong existing baselines, including ChatGPT.

Reasons To Accept:
The application of the paper is relevant and very important.
Authors have developed method to automatically extract symptoms, labels and understand persons diseases from reddit posts
Proposed model performance is better than strong baselines and something that is generally hard to achieve on mental health data given the skewed datasets. This is especially true for multi-label settings.
Reasons To Reject:
It is not clear if this can be applied to shorter comments or different social media (twitter, facebook)
To use or extend the model, psychiatric knowledge is required within the team in order to be able to understand all symptoms and how are they related to dieseases.
Questions For The Authors:
Is the dataset going to be public? Making it public (together with symptoms and disease labels) would bring a lot to mental health research.

Soundness: 3: Good: This study provides sufficient support for its major claims/arguments, some minor points may need extra support or details.
Excitement: 4: Strong: This paper deepens the understanding of some phenomenon or lowers the barriers to an existing research direction.
Reproducibility: 3: Could reproduce the results with some difficulty. The settings of parameters are underspecified or subjectively determined; the training/evaluation data are not widely available.
Ethical Concerns: No
Reviewer Confidence: 5: Positive that my evaluation is correct. I read the paper very carefully and I am very familiar with related work.




Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
The article proposes a novel framework called PsyEx, which combines symptom-based screening with psychiatric knowledge explicitly and implicitly embedded into the risky post stream. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large-scale dataset of social media posts, and the results show that it outperforms several baseline models in detecting multiple mental disorders.

Reasons To Accept:
Novel approach: This article presents a novel approach to mental disease detection that considers the possibility of multiple disorders occurring simultaneously and incorporates domain knowledge for more interpretable results.
Improved detection performance: The two-stream architecture of this approach improves detection performance by complementing symptom-based screening with psychiatric knowledge explicitly and implicitly embedded into the risky post stream.
Applicability to rare classes: This approach brings significant improvement to rarer diseases on which the baselines struggled heavily, addressing the issue of rare classes in mental disease detection.
Reasons To Reject:
1.Limited scope of population and Lack of clinical real cohort: The proposed framework is evaluated on a single dataset, which may not be representative of the general population.

Lack of explainability. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion of the interpretability of the model. Although the model is excellent at detecting mental disorders, its inner workings are still not well understood. Therefore, the paper may need to discuss in more detail how to improve the explainability of the model and explain how the model makes predictions.
3.Lack of parameter details: The article provides a detailed theoretical description of the proposed approach, but does not provide much information on parameters in practice.

Questions For The Authors:
The authors need to verify this on more data with more state-of-the-art methods. 1.Limited scope of population and Lack of clinical real cohort: The proposed framework is evaluated on a single dataset, which may not be representative of the general population.

Typos Grammar Style And Presentation Improvements:
1.add a paragraph to describe the experimental design 2.it is recommended that Figure 2 should be added more technical details of the model

Reproducibility: 4: Could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.
