  % \sansa{title suggestion: ConFu: Contrastive Fusion with Knowledge Graph for Product Search Relevance}
  With the development of Knowledge Graph (KG) in e-commerce, more and more downstream tasks can be benefited. 
  Product Search Relevance (PSR) is a fundamental and essential task in e-commerce. 
  Due to the lack of information caused by short text in this task, external knowledge is usually necessary to help model understand query intent and product essence. 
  Especially, in the life-service scenario, various products from thousands of categories with different synonyms make this task more challenging. 
  Thus, how to effectively utilize KG to improve model performance on PSR is a problem worth exploring. 
  However, conventional fusion approaches based on concatenation under-utilize the internal relation knowledge in KG, yielding sub-optimal performance.
  For instance, negative relation knowledge in KG is usually ignored in these methods.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework to fuse knowledge in KG into PSR models based on contrastive learning called Knowledge Graph Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), which outperforms other baseline methods. 
  Besides, in order to facilitate resolutions of this problem, we also release a Chinese PSR dataset along with specialized KG in our real life-service e-commerce scenario.
