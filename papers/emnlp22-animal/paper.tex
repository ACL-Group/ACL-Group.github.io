%\KZ{Maybe instead of ``culture'', we should use language environment throughout this paper, because i suspect culture is too broad.} 
This paper presents a preliminary study of the influence of human language environment on the voice of pet dogs. We create a new dataset of Shiba Inu dog barks from YouTube, which contains 4,463 audio samples along with scene and language environment of either English or Japanese. It features dog barks from eight scenes including play, alone, fight, run, stranger, walk, eat and bath. We discover certain acoustic differences in the dog barks from two language environments. We further identify some acoustic features that are potentially related to human linguistic patterns.
