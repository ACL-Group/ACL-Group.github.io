val_476,"Many physicists claim that quantum mechanics may ultimately be able to explain all fundamental phenomena , and that , ttherefore , physical theory will soon be complete . However , every theory in the history of physics that was thought to be final eventually had to be rejected for failure to explain some new observation . For this reason , we can expect that quantum mechanics will not be the final theory .		Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above ?","Only a few species of plants now grow in very dry climates ; ttherefore , few species of animals can live in those climates .",wrong
val_487,"When a patient failed to respond to prescribed medication , the doctor hypothesized that the dosage was insufficient . The doctor first advised doubling the dosage , but the patient ' s symptoms remained . It was then learned that the patient regularly drank an herbal beverage that often inhibits the medication ' s effect . The doctor then advised the patient to resume the initial dosage and stop drinking the beverage . The patient complied , but still showed no change . Finally , the doctor advised the patient to double the dosage and not drink the beverage . The patient ' s symptoms disappeared . Hence , the doctor ' s initial hypothesis was correct .		Which one of the following most accurately describes the manner in which the doctor 's second set of recommendations and the results of its application support the doctor 's initial hypothesis ?",They suggest that the beverage was not the only cause of the ineffectiveness of the prescribed dosage .,right

val_498,"A group of mountain climbers was studied to determine how they were affected by diminished oxygen in the air at high altitudes . As they climbed past 6 , 100 meters above sea level , the climbers slurred words , took longer to understand simple sentences , and demonstrated poor judgment . This combination of worsened performances disproves the theory that the area of the brain controlling speech is distinct from that controlling other functions .		The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that","the climbers ' performance in speech , comprehension , and reasoning was impaired because oxygen deprivation affected their entire brains",right
