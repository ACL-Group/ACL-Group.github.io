\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we propose \textbf{PsyEx}, a MDD framework achieving SOTA performance on the detection of multiple mental disorders. We first apply risky post screening based on symptoms, providing reliable diagnostic basis for further disease detection. We then propose a novel model architecture with a shared hierarchical encoder and disease-specific attention layers (\textit{Psychiatric Experts}). We also explore the interpretability of PsyEx by measuring the symptom contribution to MDD according to the attention from each disease expert.
