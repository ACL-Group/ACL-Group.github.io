% \KZ{We gotta be a little careful with the title: multiple mental disease detection, as it is ambigous in meaning. What does it mean by multiple mental disease? If we are saying that we can detect multiple diseases in a single person, other method can do it do, just do it one-by-one. What we are doing is detection of multiple diseases in one go.} 
Mental Disease Detection (MDD) from social media receives increasing amount of attention for its great social benefits.
%an important research topic with great social benefits. 
However, most existing methods focus on single disorder detection, overlooking the fact that many disorders might occur in tandem. What's more, they often fail to achieve satisfying performance in relatively rare classes with sparse positive samples in the dataset.
%However, most existing methods haven't achieved satisfying detection performance yet, especially in relatively rare classes. %  \MYW{this statement is arbitrary, explain the reason why - complex symptoms and vague expressions on social media? overlooking the inner connection of disease-symptom?} I've changed this sentence, check. 
Therefore, we propose PsyEx, a novel MDD framework that takes as many as 7 disorders into consideration, learning the shared clues of all diseases, while also capturing the specificity of each single disease. 
We first utilize symptom-based risky post screening to capture distinct content, and then facilitate the multi-task learning with disease-specific experts on top of a shared network. 
Experiments show that PsyEx not only boosts detection performance by 10\%, but further provides helpful interpretations to each detected post. %myw I rewrite this sentence
%provides significant improvement on those classes that baselines struggled with. 
\end{abstract}

%myw the whole paper should make it clear that: our paper is based on the taxonomy extracted from the most widely-applied clinical diagnostic standard DSM-5, from which we found the connections between symptoms and diseases. There are common and disease-specific symptoms and we build mixture of experts for each disease in a unified model. Upon this, we not only expanded the detection scope (extended previous single-disease detection to 7), but also significantly improved detection performance and achieved SOTA. PsyEx further provides interpretations for each detected post.
