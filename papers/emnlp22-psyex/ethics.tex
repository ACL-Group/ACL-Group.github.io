\section*{Ethics Statement}

\paragraph{Dataset} 

For the usage of symptom identification dataset PsySym and the MDD dataset \cite{Zhang2022SymptomIF}, we sign and comply with the data usage agreement to prevent the invasion of privacy or other potential misuses. 

\paragraph{Application} The application of mental disease detection should carry out careful analysis and examination. Since the disease labels in the MDD dataset is produced automatically by pattern matching without the guidance of psychiatrists, there are certainly some errors. Consequently, our MDD methods based on this dataset can have inherit the bias from the dataset, so it can only be used as an auxiliary tool rather than in real clinical scenarios.
