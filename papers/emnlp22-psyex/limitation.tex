\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Our work has some limitations that could be addressed in future research. 

First, we only use symptom features to screen high risk posts, but  fail to incorporate them into disease detection model. Though we have tried some ways, such as concatenating symptom features with text embedding, but it doesn't work out well. Maybe more clever methods can be proposed to better process these features in future researches.

Second, the pooling method for risky score in our post screening process is currently simplistic, and can be further refined. There are certainly options beyond max pooling that can select more symptom-relevant posts.

Finally, our model does not take useful signals from other modalities, such as image and audio, into account.
