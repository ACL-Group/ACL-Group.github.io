\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we introduce \textit{PsySym}, the first annotated multi-disease symptom identification dataset based on social media posts. A novel annotation framework is proposed to guarantee the diversity and quality of the annotations. PsySym defined two sub-tasks of symptom identification: relevance judgment and status inference, to enable a more comprehensive analysis. Strong baselines are established on the two sub-tasks with multi-disease modeling techniques that can properly handle missing labels and distribution-targeted learning to deal with the ambiguity in status inference. With PsySym-trained models, symptom-assisted MDD method can outperform strong pure-text baselines. Qualitative examples also demonstrate the explainability enabled by symptom predictions for MDD.
