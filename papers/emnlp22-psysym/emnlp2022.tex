\begin{abstract}
%  Mental diseases have been a major global health challenge, and Mental Disease Detection (MDD) from social media may enable timely help for users revealing signals of their conditions. 
%Different from human psychiatrists, most machine learning based MDD algorithms doesn't leverage 
%symptoms for diagnosis, which may be a potential reason for their relatively poor generalizability 
%and interpretability. The lack of annotated corpus is the bottleneck restricting research on symptom-assisted MDD.
Mental disease detection (MDD) from social media has suffered from poor generalizability and 
interpretability, due to lack of symptom modeling.
This paper introduces \textbf{PsySym}, the first annotated symptom identification corpus 
of multiple psychiatric disorders, to facilitate further research progress. 
  PsySym is annotated according to a knowledge graph of the 38 symptom classes related to 7 mental diseases complied from established clinical manuals and scales, and a novel annotation framework for diversity and quality. 
  Experiments show that symptom-assisted MDD enabled by PsySym can outperform strong pure-text baselines. We also exhibit the convincing MDD explanations provided by symptom predictions with case studies, and point to their further potential applications.
