\begin{abstract}
Deciphering the semantics of animal language is a grand challenge for scientists for years. 
This study presents a data-driven investigation into the semantics of dog vocalizations.  We first present a new dataset of Shiba Inu sounds with contextual information such as location and activity from YouTube with a well-constructed pipeline. Based on the analysis of the co-occurrence frequency of items in triplets, we find supporting evidence for previous heuristic research and provide some new insights into the lexical semantics of the dog language.
