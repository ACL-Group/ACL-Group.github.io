\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose DASC, a novel framework for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation. It is established on the weighted decoding paradigm for strong controllability and further grounds it in an attribute semantic space, which enables the simultaneous control of multiple attributes with the interpolation of multiple attribute embeddings. Experiments show that DASC can achieve strong controllability for multi-attribute generation while also preserving high quality in out-of-distribution scenarios. DASC is highly efficient given its much fewer number of parameters than alternatives and LLMs, making it an promising choice for deployment.
% DASC's capability of flexibly imposing control on different aspects and composing multiple attributes may open the possibility of various dialogue applications.
% \MY{Multiple controllability, light-weighted, generalization, these three arguments are the main contributions however the inner link between them are not clearly stated. Current version looks like your method can achieve this this and this, but why you are doing this and why your method can achieve them at one time needs to be thought through}
