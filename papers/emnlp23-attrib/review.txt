# Official Review of Submission2460 by Reviewer kcyB

Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
This paper proposes a framework for multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation. It uses the weighted decoding paradigm for strong controllability and further grounds it in an attribute semantic space.

Reasons To Accept:
The paper studies an important multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation task and proposes an intuitive weighted decoding method.
The analysis is comprehensive and instructive.
Reasons To Reject:
lack of some important baselines, such as FUDGE, PPLM, Cocon, and recent PLMs.

Soundness: 4: Strong: This study provides sufficient support for all of its claims/arguments.
Excitement: 3: Ambivalent: It has merits (e.g., it reports state-of-the-art results, the idea is nice), but there are key weaknesses (e.g., it describes incremental work), and it can significantly benefit from another round of revision. However, I won't object to accepting it if my co-reviewers champion it.
Reproducibility: 5: Could easily reproduce the results.
Ethical Concerns: No
Reviewer Confidence: 3: Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math, experimental design, or novelty.

Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
This paper proposes a controllable dialogue generation model. Specifically, it aims to control multiple attributes of the generated dialogue responses. The author introduces a method named Dialog Attribute Space Controller (DASC). They try to directly modify the logits of the generated sequences with some attribute classifiers and some soft labels produced by the similarity between the target attribute and next tokens. Evaluation results show that the proposed method can control the attribute of the generated responses.

Reasons To Accept:
An interesing task is investigated.

An effective method is proposed. The experiments results show that the proposed method help to enhance the controlability of different attributes.

Reasons To Reject:
The experiment section could be improved. For example, it is better to carry significance test on the human evaluation results. It is also beneficial to compare the proposed method with some most recent LLM.

The classifier of determining attributes using only parts of the sentence may not perform well. Specifically, I am wondering what is the performance of the attribute classifer obtained using Eq.2 and Eq.7.

Some of the experiment results could be explained in more details. For example, the author observes that "Compared to CTRL, DASC has lower Sensibleness but higher Interestingness", but why? Is that because DASC is bad for exhibiting Sensibleness? Similar results are also observed in Table1.

Soundness: 3: Good: This study provides sufficient support for its major claims/arguments, some minor points may need extra support or details.
Excitement: 3: Ambivalent: It has merits (e.g., it reports state-of-the-art results, the idea is nice), but there are key weaknesses (e.g., it describes incremental work), and it can significantly benefit from another round of revision. However, I won't object to accepting it if my co-reviewers champion it.
Reproducibility: 4: Could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.
Ethical Concerns: No
Reviewer Confidence: 4: Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings.

Paper Topic And Main Contributions:
The authors aim to generate personalized conversations (gender, mood, etc.) through techniques for controlled conversation generation. They proposed DASC(Dialog Attribute Space Controller) to control multiple attributes at the same time to generate personalized replies, that is, multi-attribute controlled conversation generation. The author proposes a new weighted decoding method. Each lexeme in the vocabulary is mapped to an Attribute semantic space through the Attribute Token Embedding. The hidden state of the language model is also transformed into the Attribute Context Embedding in the space through the attribute-specific layer. Then, a dot-product-based attribute classifier assigns higher weights to adjacent words embedded in the current context in the attribute space, thus achieving weighted control in the decoding process. Experiments on open domain dialogue datasets show that DASC achieves strong controllability in combinatorial control tasks, the visualization of attribute lexical embedment clearly shows the specific pattern related to control, and the controllability of DASC for a single attribute is also guaranteed.

Reasons To Accept:
Different from previous work, the author deals with the attributes of characters separately and turns it into a multi-attribute controllable dialogue generation task, which enables us to explore how different attributes affect dialogue generation, and the author makes this process very clear, which is very helpful for subsequent work.

Reasons To Reject:
The author has little exploration of the previous works. The experiment is not comprehensive enough. Most of the comparison of the author's experimental results is based on the accuracy of attribute prediction. Still, some models do not adopt this method to deal with attributes (such as overall processing) and can obtain good generated results, and these models have not been compared.

Missing References:
Many models do not get a chance to compare, such as BoB: BERT Over BERT for Training Persona-based Dialogue Models from Limited Personalized Data (Song et al., ACL-IJCNLP 2021).

This work Enhances Personalized Dialogue Generation with Contrastive Latent Variables: Combining Sparse and Dense Persona (Tang et al., ACL 2023) is similar to the author's work, except that it addresses "multi-attribute controlled conversation generation" in text descriptions, which the authors can try to focus on. Of course, this is just advice, I wouldn't ask for it (in the three months before the deadline).

Soundness: 3: Good: This study provides sufficient support for its major claims/arguments, some minor points may need extra support or details.
Excitement: 4: Strong: This paper deepens the understanding of some phenomenon or lowers the barriers to an existing research direction.
Reproducibility: 4: Could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.
