\section*{Limitations}
Despite the significant advancements made by our approach, several limitations remain. 
First, our current dataset does not encode tone information and its evolution, which may be beneficial crucial for accurately reconstructing ancient Chinese pronunciation and for educational purpose. Future work will focus on enhancing the dataset by incorporating detailed tonal information. Furthermore, the dataset currently lacks non-linguistic features such as geographical, natural, and political factors that could influence phonetic changes over time. Including these features could provide a more holistic understanding of ancient Chinese phonetic reconstruction and improve the model's accuracy, especially on low-resource scenarios.

Addressing these limitations would enhance the robustness and applicability of our methodology, thereby advancing the field of computational reconstruction of ancient Chinese phonology.
