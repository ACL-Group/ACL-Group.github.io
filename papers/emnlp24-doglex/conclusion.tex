\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a method with HuBERT to explore canine sound units. In contrast to previous work, this approach uses a self-supervised method, instead of relying on human language knowledge, to explore sound units in canine language. This is better suited for exploring fine-grained sound units in canine language. Then we use Hybird Variational-MCMC Inference to train the parameters of the Adaptor Grammar, ultimately obtaining a candidate vocabulary. By dog activity events surrounding the dog vocalizations, we find there are some words has a strong correlation between activities. 

%These vocabulary words are uttered by multiple dogs and exhibit significant consistency. Future research can detect other information about the dog, such as behavior, mood, location, etc., to explore the meaning carried by these vocabulary words. We developed a web-based dog vocalization labeling system. Users can upload a dog audio and easily access the words in the vocabulary we found.
