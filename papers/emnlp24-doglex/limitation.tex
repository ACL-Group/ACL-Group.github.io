\section*{Limitation}

The discovery of dog sound units heavily relies on the quality of the dataset. 
Even though we have implemented multiple measures to enhance the dataset's quality, noise may still be present due to various factors, including the recording equipment, background noise, or added noise by video uploaders. 
Discovering words in an unfamiliar human language presents a challenging problem due to noise, mispronunciation, etc. The same difficulty exists with dogs. One possible solution to achieve better results is by acquiring more datasets and considering the more context of the dog barks.
