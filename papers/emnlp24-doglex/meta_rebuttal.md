Existing concepts in human linguistics can actually help us research other animals, 
as long as we remain critical and open-minded [1]. A large body of research has shown 
that many animal species exhibit characteristics in human language, albeit to a
lesser extent [2, 3]. For examples:

- Bottlenose dolphins are capable of generalizing rules, developing abstract concepts and syntactic understanding in an artificial communication system [4].
- Leroux et al. [5] provided evidence for syntactic-like structuring in chimpanzee communication.
- Favaro et al. [6] has shown that penguin's calls display linguistic similarity with words in human speech.
- Ficken, Hailman, and Hailman [7] illustrated that Mexican chickadee have simple units of sound and can form a call system with a variety of meanings by combining different units. 
- Structured sound sequences produced by humpback whales are described as hierarchically organized songs[8]. 

In a similar spirit, we give explicit definitions of "phones" (line: 218), "words" (line: 264), and "sentences" (line: 150) for canine communication in the paper. In fact, these definitions are not exactly the same as those in human linguistics.

Regarding the use of limited number of activities to characterize dog word semantics, 
we want to stress that this work is only an initial attempt to approximate "word" semantics 
in canine communications, and it is by no means complete.
Because there is no existing semantic categories for canines, we attempted to identify 
common semantic categories based on the most frequent dog activities from 
a large number of YouTube videos. Limiting the semantics categories to 13 dog activities 
as we did in the paper enables us to identify the semantic categories from Youtube videos
with higher accuracy.
