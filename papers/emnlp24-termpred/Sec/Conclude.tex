\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we proposed a new approach, \lawgraph{}, to represent statutory provisions as graphs, and a lightweight Statute Knowledge Encoder (SKE) for end-to-end training for the prison term prediction (PTP) task. We performed extensive experiments to compare SKE with previous works and LLMs and results indicated the superiority of the proposed method over previous methods. The experiments also demonstrate that the proposed \lawgraph{} is effective for extracting structural legal knowledge for this task. The benefit is from the \lawgraph{} constructed process following legal theory and the Legislative Technical Specification.
