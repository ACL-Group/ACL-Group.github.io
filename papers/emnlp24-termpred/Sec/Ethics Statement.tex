\section*{Ethic Statement}
\paragraph{Privacy Concerns.} The cases analyzed in this paper are sourced from the open dataset CAIL2018, which has been widely utilized in prior research. Given that these cases are published on China Judgment Online and have been anonymized, the risk of disclosing personal information about the individuals involved is minimal. Nonetheless, to enhance privacy protection and adhere to ethical standards, we will only release the case indices, not the full text of the cases.

\paragraph{Individual Affected Concerns.} While our proposed methods can achieve some improvements compared to previous research, there is still a gap in achieving flawless prediction. We highly respect and understand that if the proposed methods are used in the real world, incorrect predictions may cause serious consequences. We want to highlight that this is only a forward step in this research topic; we have no intent to implement the predicted model in actual court settings immediately. 

\paragraph{Responsible Usage.} At this stage, the proposed methods still have some limitations. We do not recommend that any users blindly trust the model's output. The output may be seen as a suggestion, but the final legal opinion should be made by professional legal experts. Users should be aware that errors may exist in the output. Besides, any use of this tool as legal advice should comply with local laws and administrative regulations.
