\section*{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitation}

Our work has some limitations that could be addressed in future research. 

This work only interacts with depressed users in Weibo, but there are more depressed users in Weibo, posting frequently, which can reflect the posting situation of depressed users in China to some extent, and can be used as the basis for subsequent interaction with other social media, such as Twitter, Facebook and other depressed users.

In this work, our focus is on the analysis of the users of depression hyperbole. However, some depressed users have not joined the depression talk, and the future work can expand the scope of interaction.

In reality, individuals often experience multiple mental disorders at the same time, which brings additional challenges. Chatbots playing depressed users need to simulate complex symptom combinations, which may be difficult to replicate accurately. We hope to extend our approach to a wider range of mental illness in the future.
