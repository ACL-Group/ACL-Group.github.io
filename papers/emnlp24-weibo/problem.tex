\label{sec:problem}
In order to understand ``How to Break the Ice with Depressed Social Media User'', we should address the following problems: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How to find depressed users who need help on Weibo?
	\item How to start a conversation with the target user on Weibo?
\end{enumerate}

%... Therefore, we first train..... "
%Our goal is to build a system that can identify depressed users on Weibo and start an icebreaker that potentially leads
%to more useful emotional support or therapeutic conversation using other mental health specific chatbots. 
%which can help online depressed users on social media to alleviate their symptoms. 
%We seek to address the following technical problems:
Therefore, we first train a depressed user detector to find users with depression, and then we find posts for ice-breaking in the posting history of target users (see \figref{fig:pipeline1}).
%Therefore, we first train a classifier of depression detection\MY{pls check here, what's classifier for depression detection? a depression user detector?} to find the depressed users, and then train a classifier of the best ice-breaking point to find the posts to reply\MY{rewrite here too, make it clear that what this classifier is about}. Then, we use our Proactive Ice-breaking System to comment on depressed users and find best ice-breaking strategies based on the results\MY{you haven't properly introduced this system yet, say with concise language on what you did.}.
