Paper Summary:
This work designs a pipeline to monitor posts by potentially depressed users on Weibo in real-time, initiate conversations with them using icebreakers, and shows that depressed users prefer interacting with humans, especially those who have recovered from depression, and that different ice-breaking strategies are needed for different user posts. This research lays the groundwork for developing more proactive dialogue systems for online depression diagnosis and symptom relief.

Summary Of Strengths:
The topic is important due to its potential to identify and address mental health issues early.
The pipeline of the proposed work is interesting.
The dataset is novel, as it involves real-time monitoring of posts by potentially depressed users on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, providing unique insights for proactive mental health interventions.
Summary Of Weaknesses:
The dataset is taken from the Chinese social media Weibo, so the data diversity is a concern in the proposed work. Authors can explore some other social media platforms and combine the dataset.
Data and code are not available to validate the work.
The validity of the ‘depressed users detector’ is not mentioned in the manuscript.
The captions in Figure 2 and Figure 3 are not grammatically correct.
The proposed architecture is missing in the work, although the authors have mentioned the pipeline.
While creating this type of sensitive data set usually, domain experts are required, but authors did it by themself, which raises a serious question about the authenticity of the data.
The authors recruited a volunteer to evaluate the strategies used in each reply. Not much information is provided about the volunteer’s skill or educational background, or compensation.
Comments Suggestions And Typos:
Please see the points in the Weaknesses section.

Confidence: 3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design.
Soundness: 3 = Acceptable: This study provides sufficient support for its major claims/arguments. Some minor points may need extra support or details.
Overall Assessment: 2.5
Best Paper: No
Needs Ethics Review: No
Reproducibility: 3 = They could reproduce the results with some difficulty. The settings of parameters are underspecified or subjectively determined, and/or the training/evaluation data are not widely available.
Datasets: 3 = Potentially useful: Someone might find the new datasets useful for their work.
Software: 3 = Potentially useful: Someone might find the new software useful for their work.

Paper Summary:
This paper designs a pipeline to monitor posts and find potential depressed users in real-time on the social network medium. This study shows depressed users prefer to interact with humans and they prefer to interact with people who have recovered from depression.

Summary Of Strengths:
This work proposes a proactive dialogue system for online depression diagnosis and symptom relief.

Summary Of Weaknesses:
The overall design and motivation might not be reasonable. The authors need to provide psychological research findings to justify their motivation.

The terms of diagnosis and relief are closer to the medical domains so the evaluations in this paper may not represent the real-world scenarios.

Comments Suggestions And Typos:
Dataset: This paper detects depressed users from an online depression discussion community. Does the data collection process have biases?

Proactive approach: Passive chatbots may have low effectiveness but due to many human-related reasons, the proposed proactive pipeline may not have the real needs. To solve the problem of helping depressed users in online communities, the proposed methods need more psychological findings and support. If the proactive method is not preferred by real-world scenarios, this study needs careful reconsideration.

The abstract is too high-level, and the authors need to add technology details to certain degrees.

Confidence: 3 =  Pretty sure, but there's a chance I missed something. Although I have a good feel for this area in general, I did not carefully check the paper's details, e.g., the math or experimental design.
Soundness: 2 = Poor: Some of the main claims/arguments are not sufficiently supported. There are major technical/methodological problems.
Overall Assessment: 2 = Revisions Needed: This paper has some merit, but also significant flaws, and needs work before it would be of interest to the community.
Best Paper: No
Needs Ethics Review: No
Reproducibility: 3 = They could reproduce the results with some difficulty. The settings of parameters are underspecified or subjectively determined, and/or the training/evaluation data are not widely available.

Paper Summary:
presents a proactive approach to engaging with depressed users on social media platforms, specifically Sina Weibo in China
propose a novel pipeline that identifies potential depressed users in real-time and initiates ice-breaking conversations to help alleviate their depressive symptoms.
aims to address the limitations of current chatbots that passively wait for users to initiate interactions, which is less effective for individuals with depression who may be reluctant to seek help due to social stigma.
developed a depressed user identification protocol to screen for depressed users by monitoring the Depression Super Topic Community on Weibo.
collected a dataset of 2,193 users and annotated their posts into four categories: emotional expression, daily life sharing, psychological state reflection, and asking for help and support. Using these categories, the study devised eight interaction roles and four emotional support strategies to generate appropriate ice-breaking responses
Summary Of Strengths:
introduces a proactive approach to engaging with depressed users on social media, which addresses the limitation of existing passive chatbots.
development of a user identification protocol to screen for potential depressed users in real-time.
comprehensive data collection (although not sure if it will be released)
Summary Of Weaknesses:
concludes that users prefer human interactions over chatbot interactions which shows that there is more work needed for the effectiveness of the chatbots.
social media platforms might not be the best place for this experiment because an user might not prefer messages from an unknown chatbot/person or it might also trigger them. It would've been better setting where the user has signed up for the experiment.
some sections, particularly the methodology and the experimental setup, are dense and complex, which may make it difficult for readers to fully grasp the approach and replicate the study.
would've been good to see some experiments with finetuned large language models instead of just prompt engineering with ChatGPT.
Comments Suggestions And Typos:
It would've be good to restructure the Experiments section a little bit more. Like at first the explain the experiments done and then another section for all the results. The case study can be a different section. Also it would be good to include some more relevant papers on depression detection and mental health risks like below:
