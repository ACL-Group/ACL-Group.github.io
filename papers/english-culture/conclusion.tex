\section{Conclusion}
Our study of the co-occurrence based algorithms and the neural network based
Skip-gram model shows the effectiveness of word embedding for capturing
semantic differences in a word between British and American uses.
However, this is a very challenging task as the overall accuracy 
is still under 0.5. As future work,
more sophisticated models and other evaluation metrics maybe developed
to better solve this problem.
%to improve the accuracy. In addition, alternate ways of evaluating our results
%maybe developed to demonstrate the capability of discoverying the second
%type of cultural difference: that is different uses of the same word,
%despite identical meaning from the two cultures.
