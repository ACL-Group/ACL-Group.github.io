\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
This work targets to a practical recommendation problem named exact-K recommendation,
we prove that it is different from traditional top-K recommendation.
%Numerous researches have been proposed targeting to the Top-K recommendation,
%our work mainly focuses on Exact-K recommendation.
In the first step, we give a formal problem definition,
then reduce it to a Maximal Clique Optimization problem which is a combinatorial optimization problem and NP-hard.
To tackle this specific problem, we propose a novel approach of \emph{GAttN with RLfD}.
In our evaluation, we perform extensive analysis to demonstrate the highly positive effect of our proposed method targeting exact-K recommendation problem.
In our future work, we plan to adopt adversarial training for the components of Reward Estimator and REINFORCE learning, regarding as discriminator and generator in GAN's \cite{goodfellow2014generative} perspective.
Moreover further online A/B testing in production will be conducted.
