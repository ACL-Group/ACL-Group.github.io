Most existing related works just consider the contact history but do not consider the map information. \cite{Whitbeck10:Plausible} solve this problem by force analysis. It assumes that there exists four different forces as attraction, repulsion, drag and anticipated attraction, furthermore each node will be affected by these four forces at any moment. This paper take each contact history as the anticipated attraction, then through force analysis they infer the traces out to get the map information. But in the real world, we can't justify there really exist such kinds of forces. Even though these forces really exist, but we wonder whether these forces could lead to the node's movement.  

Some other works \cite{Vtrack} \cite{Malnet} \cite{Vulnerability} could infer the trace by GPS information which is actually not available in 
our work.
