In this paper, we define a new problem about finding out the language influence of the host on the barking sounds of Shiba Inu dogs. Experiments have shown that there is a significant difference between the voice of dogs in the Japanese language environment and the English environment. By analyzing the acoustic prominent factors, we find that there is a correlation between the voice of dogs and the voice of humans. Our EJShibaVoice dataset will facilitate future research in this field.
