\section* {Limitations}
\paragraph{Dataset Limitation}
We construct the dataset on our own with crawler tool and sound event detection tool. There is noise for two aspects: the first is the video source noise, there are few videos which are not satisfied with our conditions. For example, there are other species of dogs or dogs from unreal environments. The second is that we need a larger dataset, which contains more scenes and clips.


% limitation: dataset noise and size
\paragraph{Analysis Between Dogs and Humans}
For understanding the relationship between voice of dogs and humans at a deeper level, we have analyzed the prominent factors and find the same characteristics between dogs and humans. However, the qualitative analysis is not that descriptive compared to quantitative analysis, which is our future work.

% lack of more straight quantitative analysis between human and dogs
