\maketitle
 
\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a preliminary investigation into how the human language environment influences pet dog barking sounds.
We first present a new dataset of Shiba Inu dog barks from YouTube, which contains 9,200 audio pairs, each with two audio clips under matching scenarios from either English or Japanese host language environments. 
These scenarios are in different activities, locations, and scenes that might give rise to the difference in dog barking. With a classification task and prominent factor analysis, we discover significant acoustic differences in the dog barks from two language environments. We further identify some acoustic features that are potentially related to human language phonetic patterns.
