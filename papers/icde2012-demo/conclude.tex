\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We presented an algorithm to automatically extract top-k lists from
the web. What distinguishes this work from previous list extraction
algorithms is that we are not concerned with extracting all the list objects
from a page assuming all the repetitive segments in the page are valid objects,
regardless of whether they come from the same list. While this is a common
scenario for deep web mining, we focus on identifying one main list in 
a page and extract it only if it has exactly $k$ items. This is the case
of ``Top K'' like web page and the information herein is very valuable for
concept instantiation and fact answering. While the idea of using 
tag paths to identify repeative HTML elements is not new, 
we have introduced several new technique to adapt to the top-k list extraction
problem. For future work of this paper, we are interested in
two directions. One direction is to how to retrieve as many top-k pages as
possible from the web. This task is related to suitable search
query generation, e.g. generation of key words can match top-k page titles.
The other direction is refine the returned list items to retrieve a concise
and accurate name for the instance or entity if available.
