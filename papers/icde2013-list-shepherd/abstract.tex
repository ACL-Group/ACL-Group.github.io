\begin{abstract}
  This paper is concerned with information extraction from top-$k$ web
  pages, which are web pages that describe top $k$ instances of a
  topic which is of general interest. Examples
  include ``the 10 tallest buildings in the world'', ``the 50 hits of
  2010 you don't want to miss'', etc.  Compared to other structured
  information on the web (including web tables), information in
  top-$k$ lists is larger and richer, of higher quality, and generally
  more interesting.  Therefore top-$k$ lists are highly valuable. For
  example, it can help enrich open-domain knowledge bases (to support
  applications such as search or fact answering).  In this paper, we
  present an efficient method that extracts top-$k$ lists from web
  pages with high performance.  Specifically, we extract more than 1.7
  million top-$k$ lists from a web corpus of 1.6 billion pages with
  92.0\% precision and 72.3\% recall.
