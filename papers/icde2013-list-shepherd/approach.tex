Figure \ref{fig:sys} shows the block diagram of our system.  The
system consists of the following components: (1) Title Classifier,
which attempts to recognize the page title of the input web page; (2)
Candidate Picker, which extracts all potential top-$k$ lists
from the page body as candidate lists;  (3) Top-K Ranker, which
scores each candidate list and picks the best one;  (4) Content
Processor, which postprocesses the extracted list to further produce attribute
values, etc..
Next we discuss each component in detail.


%As the input of the system, the web page is first parsed by
%an HTML parser\cite{winista} to obtain a complete DOM representation.
%First of all, the title classifier attempts to recognize the page title of the input web page.
%If it is a ``top-$k$ like'' title,
%the classifier outputs the list size (the number $k$)
%and a set of possible concepts mentioned in the title.
%With the number $k$, the candidate picker extracts all lists of size $k$
%from the page body as candidate lists. Only one of them will be the actual
%list of interest. With the concept set,
%the top-$k$ ranker can score each candidate list and pick the best one
%as the top-$k$ list.  Finally the content processor
%normalizes the list content
%and conceptualizes the main entities in the list
%as well as their attributes, if any.
%
%The rest of the section is organized as follows.
%First we will talk about title recognition in Subsection \ref{sec:title},
%including generating training material (titles), designing model pattern
%and building the title classifier.
%Second we will discuss list extraction in Subsection \ref{sec:extractList}, which consists of
%preprocessing, clustering candidate lists , ranking and selecting the top-$k$ list, as well as postprocessing.
%In addition, some misc topics in the design of the system will be mentioned at the end of the section (Subsection \ref{sec:additionalTopic}).
