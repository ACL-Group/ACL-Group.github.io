This paper studies the problem of identifying false statements. The main contribution is to look at the problem through graph structures. The model measures the similarity between propagation trees and then uses it for SVM kernel in a hybrid fashion. The model achieves a high accuracy on this problem, which is quite promising. It is reassuring that results are consistent in the SVM turing and end-to-end comparision.
However, there are several major concerns:
1. The title is quite misleading. Although there is no commonly accepted definition of rumor, in both dictionaries and previous literatures (e.g., DiFonzo and Bordia 2007, Allport and Postman 1947), an important characteristic of rumor is uncertainty. However, this paper works on only false statements. That said, this is still an interesting problem to study. (Although it was used in same way in Yang et al. 2012 and redefining terms in a paper is OK, it is still misleading here.)
2. The setup assumes that the entire propagation forrests has been seen, which is not really realistic. This can also partly explain the high accuracy in such a difficult task. It makes more sense to try to detect false statements early in the propagation. This idea has been explored for predicting future virality in previous literatures (Romero et al. 2013, Cheng et al. 2014). It would be interesting to see whether it is possible to predict false statements with a small number of propagations.
3. The model makes simplification based on opinion leaders and normal users. It has been shown that simple graph features can already be quite helpful in previous literatures. This is probably a more appropriate baseline to compare with.
In terms of writing, there are several places where a space is missing before "(". Also, citations are not consistent.

This paper focuses on the problem of rumor detection on Sina Weibo. Authors propose a graph-kernel based hybrid SVM classifier which captures the high-order propagation patterns in addition to semantic features such as topics and sentiments. Specifically, authors model the pattern of message propagation as a tree, and propose a random walk graph kernel to model the similarity of propagation trees. In addition, authors combine graph kernel and radial basis function kernel to build a hybrid SVM classifier. The proposed framework to detect rumor is quite interesting, but I have several concerns on this paper: The significance of this work may be limited. Between 2012/05/28 and 2014/04/11, there may be millions of posts on Sina Weibo, but only 11466 rumors are reported. This data shows the detecting rumors in Sina Weibo may not be a significant problem. In addition, authors construct a balanced dataset (2601 rumors and 2536 non-rumors) to conduct the classification task. However, in the real world, the distribution of rumor and non-rumor should be very skewed. Thus, the experimental results are not convincing enough. Some technical details are not explained in this paper. For example, the method to calculate doubt score and approval score is not explained in Section 3.1 and Section 3.3.

This paper suggests that rumors and facts can be distiguished based on propagation patterns of messages on social networks, in addition to textual and user-based features studied in previous works. The authors present a graph kernel based approach to incorporate higher order propagation features in the discriminative classification setup.
I have a few questions for the authors after the initial review:
1. How do the authors know the particular message that another message ('response') is a response to? A user may have sent many messages and mere presence of @username would not distinguish one message from others from the same user.
2. In Table 2, the authors present an ablation style (leave one feature out) performance values. For comparison, also state baselines such as (a) only old features (i.e. performance without any new features or graph kernel), (b) old features + graph kernel, (c) only graph features (\beta=1 setting, no old or new features) on the 'small data set'.
Here are some additional suggestions:
1. Definition of rumor as given in Sec. 1: Cite relevant literature supporting this definition, specifically about characterizing rumors to be 'widely circulated', as that is important for the current work.
2. The authors ignore works on trustworthiness of information using source, information network, and text features that seems relevant to task of rumor detection.
3. The authors make a strong claim that seems to suggest that rumors are primarily characterized by influence of multiple opinion leaders (Sec. 3). The experiments probably supported a lesser (but arguably still significant) claim that propagation features further complement text and user features. In general, the authors should avoid making extraordinary claims (and words such as 'outstanding', 'deal changing', 'superb') without considering and rejecting alternate hypotheses.
