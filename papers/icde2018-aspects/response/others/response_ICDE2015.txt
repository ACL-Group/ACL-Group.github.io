We appreciate the precious comments given by the reviewers and we thank 
them for their hard work. Below are our responses to the individual reviews.

R1:
*** "Early detection results are not compared to early detection using other 
systems"
Answer: Following your comment, we experimented with rumor early detection on 
two other algorithms, namely Yang and Castillo, used as comparisons in the paper. 
The results: for Yang's method, accuracy = 73.25% at t = 0, 
accuracy = 76.94% at t = 24 hours; for Castillo's method, 
accuracy = 73.75% at t = 0, accuracy =  83.25% at t = 24 hours. 
The accuracy of the three methods (including ours) at time 0 are mostly 
the same because three methods share similar basic features when 
there is no repost. However, after 24 hours, Yang's result improves a little, 
Castillo's improves substantially, while ours improves the most. 
This is because Yang's method uses few features related to reposting 
(e.g., "IS RETWEETED", "NUM OF COMMENTS", "NUM OF RETWEETES"), 
Castillo's method include some simple but effective features of 
reposting such as "AVG SENTIMENT SCORE" and "PROPAGATION MAX LEVEL", 
while our method have considered the propagation structure as well as 
many other reposting features and thus benefits from the signals from
reposts most. Among the three methods, ours converges most quickly in terms of
early false rumor detection. Since there's space in our paper, if it's
accepted, we can add these results in the revised version. 

*** "The paper does not discuss how the proposed techniques can be 
transferred to other micro-blogging platforms"
Answer: Although a few user-related features such as "gender" and "location" 
are either not available or inprecise on Twitter, 
many other new and useful features, especially those related to message 
and reposting can be extracted using the Twitter API. 
In fact, most of the old features in our paper were proposed in 
Castillo et al., which targeted Twitter specifically. 

*** "Please use the exact number for accuracy at 24 hrs"
Answer: We agree with your suggestion and will correct it in the 
revised version.

R2:
*** "The effect of this simplification in the rumor propagation is 
never discussed/analyzed in a formal way"
Answer: The parameter alpha controls the number of opinion leaders and 
hence the size of the simplified tree. We showed the effects of alpha in 
Figure 9 and Figure 10 and discussed such effects in the text. 
When alpha = 0, the tree can be considered as not simplified.  

*** "...which might render the applicability of the proposed methods uncertain"
Answer: Please refer to the response of R1. 

R3:
*** "This may be a tedious process and may not be effectively implemented 
on platforms where it is difficult to obtain all the responses and 
reposts from other uses"
Answer: First, responses and reposts on Twitter and Sina Weibo, 
which are two widely used micro-blogging platforms, can be easily 
extracted through their APIs. Furthermore, results show that we can
detect false rumors with an accuracy of 88% just one day after 
the original message is posted, which means our approach require just a small
subset of responses and reposts to be effective. 

*** "What constitutes as an `original' message may be subjective when 
it is not clearly indicated if a message is in response to an earlier one 
and/or the user added in new content to the message"
Answer: On Sina Weibo, all original messages and response messages are clearly 
marked as such, hence confusion is unlikely. It is possible for some one to
reply to a thread and start a new topic, but such cases are rare and 
are not considered as original messages.

*** "It may be better to look at the average increase in accuracies 
between the graph kernel feature and different sets of features before 
claiming that such a feature is a `deal changer'"
Answer: While the key contribution of this paper is the inclusion of the graph
kernel feature, such a feature works best in combination with some of
the newly added features, which is why we propose them. Our results already
showed that by removing each of the new features individually, graph kernel
feature is the most significant among them. It is true that by adding
the graph kernel feature to the set of old features, the algorithm logs
a 0.035 increase in accuracy. According to our additional experiments,
this is the largest increase achieved by adding any new features to 
the set of old ones.
