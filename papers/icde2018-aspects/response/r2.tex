\section{Response to Reviewer 2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item [Q1:] The approach requires tuning a lot of parameters. The authors indicate in the paper how they have selected the values for the parameters. However they do not discuss whether their results would still be valid for different values of these parameters. Also they do not discuss how such parameters would be tuned when the framework is used in a real setting. Would the parameters be set by the end-user?
	\item [A1:] 
	Most of the parameters are tuned without knowing the ground truth aspect words. For example, we evaluate the parameter N (the number of the sentence clusters in part B, sec. III ) is based on an unsupervised loss, which is the sum of euclidean distances from cluster center to each point within the cluster (Figure 5).  Such parameters can be tuned in the same way in a real setting. Moreover, end-users usually only care about the desired number of aspect words, 
and other parameters of our framework can be automatically tuned in such an 
unsupervised way.
	
	\item [Q2:] 
	%[D1]
	I appreciate particularly the use of ontology to improve the clustering. One question, though, is how to obtain/generate the ontology in real settings.
	\item [A2:] 
	Our parameters have been set for real settings. \KZ{What is this??}
