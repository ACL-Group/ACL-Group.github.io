\section{Conclusion}
This paper defines a new problem called commonsense causality generation and automatic builds a cause-effect
pairs corpus which facilitates the causality generation task.
This paper also proposes a causal attention mechanism
as well as an attention fusion mechanism, 
which combines the global causal information observed from external causal knowledge CausalNet with the locally learned causal dependency under the encoder-decoder sequence to sequence framework.
Our evaluation results vaidate our proposed model,
which outperforms multiple strong baselines by a substantial margin.
