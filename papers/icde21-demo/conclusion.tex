\section{Conclusion}
We develop a light-weight 
%but dataset and model independent 
framework that evaluates the potential biases and cues in NLI multiple choice 
datasets and further shed light on
the exploration of models at least from the perspective of the statistical cues. 
We experimented on a large range of datasets covering different tasks and 
conclude that the new evaluation framework is effective in discovering
bias problems in some popular models.
%and widely applicable. 
% Further research will be
%directed to better ways of de-biasing the dataset and other ways to improve general model 
%robustness.
