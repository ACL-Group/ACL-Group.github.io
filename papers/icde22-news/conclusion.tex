\section{Conclusion}

Session-based recommendations are indispensable under the streaming-like 
or real-time scenario when users' historical records are unavailable. 
By leveraging the positive and negative implicit feedback from users, as well
as properly modeling the times in the problem, 
our proposed method is simple but effective to improve the 
trade-off between accuracy, diversity and surendipity, 
as shown in experimental results. In future, we will investigate whether it is 
beneficial to plug the positive/negative modules into more sophisticated 
session-based recommendation approaches.
