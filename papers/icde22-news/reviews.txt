6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
In this paper, the authors propose to use temporal information and statistics as implicit feedback in session-based news recommendation. An attention-based method is proposed to apply this concept, thereby deriving similarity scores with a two-tower structure. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements over several conventional methods.
7. Describe in detail all strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1: Interesting ideas to exploit temporal and statistical information in news reading for identifying implicit feedback.
S2: Experiments with real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
S3: Case studies show more detailed properties about the proposed method.
8. Describe in detail all opportunities for improvement, labeled O1, O2, O3, etc.
O1: Significance tests of improvements are missing.
O2: It could be better to have more elaboration on model design. For example, the choice of using the Bahdanau attention instead of other attention types, e.g., multi-head attention is not explained.
O3: The code and scripts are not available.
9. Please rank the three most critical strong points and/or opportunities for improvement that led to your overall evaluation rating, e.g., "{S1, O7, O4}"
{S1, S2, O2, O1, O3}
10. Inclusive writing: does the paper follow the ICDE inclusive writing guidelines with respect to language, examples, figures? Please provide suggestions to the authors on how to improve the writing of the paper according to the guidelines.
Yes.
11. Availability: We have asked authors of all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available if this is possible. You can find this information in the summary of the paper on CMT.

6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
The paper presents a session-based recommender that exploits the content of the items, the context, and additional signals implicit feedback signals.
7. Describe in detail all strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1. The paper presents the approach in a clear manner.

S2. The approach outperforms various baselines in several settings.
8. Describe in detail all opportunities for improvement, labeled O1, O2, O3, etc.
O1. The paper has marginal contribution. The proposed solution is based on context (the neutral feedback), item content, and additional signals (like active time, exposed but not clicked items) to infer users preferences. All these aspects have been considered before, if not together, in the context of session-based recommenders. In fact, in 2019 Trivago released a dataset and a corresponding challenge for session-based recommendation that has all these characteristics.

O2. Some notions are not completely in line with literature. For instance, clicks are always considered implicit feedback; anything that does not involve the user explicitly rating an item is implicit feedback. And in fact all modern recommendation techniques operate with implicit feedback. Moreover, the concept of "neutral implicit feedback" is just the context of the recommendation. The "positive implicit feedback" refers to additional signals that can indicate whether the user explicitly liked the item. Similarly, "negative implicit feedback" refers to items that are exposed but not interacted with; this is typically taken into account by adopting the negative sampling strategy, as also proposed here.

6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
This paper focuses on userâ€™s implicit feedback in news recommendation and proposes to use different encoders to model positive, negative and neutral feedback. Attention is the mainly used techniques in the proposed framework. Experimental results shows that the proposed framework performs better than most baselines.
7. Describe in detail all strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1 This paper proposes neutral implicit feedback which models user interests more accurately.

S2 Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the method as well as each component of it.

S3 The paper is easy to follow.
8. Describe in detail all opportunities for improvement, labeled O1, O2, O3, etc.
O1 The idea on neutral feedback is interesting but the technical contribution and novelty of this paper is limited. The attention mechanism is the core technique of this paper, which however has been well and widely studied.

O2 The overall performance gain is not significant, especially on the Globo dataset. In other words, the advantage of the proposed model is not obvious.


O3 In ablation study, the proposed method shows similar or comparable performance with the simple random sampling method. The improvement towards baselines is trivial.
