\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this paper we introduce a new Recursive Neural Network called Code-RNN to extract the topic or function of the source code. This new Recursive Neural Network is the parse tree of the source code and we go through all the tree from leaf nodes to root node to get the final representation vector. Then we use this vector to classify the source into some clusters according to the function, and classification results are acceptable. We also connect the Code-RNN to basic Recurrent Neural Network end-to-end to generate the comments for methods in seven projects. We also propose two Sequence-to-Sequence models to generate comments as baseline, because the models we found that generate comments are all based one fixed template. According to results, Code-RNN outperforms both two Sequence-to-Sequence models.

In the future work, we can add the call graph into our model, so that Code-RNN can contain invocation information and extract more topics from source code.
