Sentiment analysis studies the expression and interpretation of human opinions. As an important part of sentiment analysis, automatic document summarization is a very important task. As the amount of online reviews is growing exponentially, there is an increasing demand for systems that can analyze and summarize the opinions. In this paper we focus on aspect-based review summarization, which is a useful and popular form seen on websites like TripAdvisor.com. However, instead of asking the users to rate on various aspects, we are interested in building a system that can automatically generate such summarization. Specifically, we focus on the task of determining the proper aspects for a product from the review data. The large number of product types makes it intractable for manually labeling those aspects and difficult for supervised learning. On the other hand, the amount of unlabled user reviews makes it tempting and plausible for unsupervised learning. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised multistage clustering approach for finding the best aspect words from user reviews, leveraging techniques like clustering, topic modeling and deep learning for natural language processing. In our experiments, we show that our system outperformed other single-stage methods designed for aspect extraction. We also show that, combined with a sentiment prediction backend, our system can help produce a complete summarization that is far clearer than what is now available on many e-commerace websites.
