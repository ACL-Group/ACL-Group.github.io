\section{CONCLUSION}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper develops a scheme to representation causality knowledge, and propose a framework to mine such a kind of causality knowledge, The result shows our solution is pretty well.

In the future, We would like to mine more rules based on more bigger data, and empower the downstream applications such as QA about answer the Why type question, Event Prediction which can predict the possible leading events given one happened event via the causality rule
