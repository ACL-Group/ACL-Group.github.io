\section{Conclusion}

%To the best of our knowledge, 
%this is the first piece of work that focuses on 
In this paper, we conduct
extractive summarization for E-commerce product title.
We propose a deep and wide model, combining attentional RNN
framework with rich semantic features such as TF-IDF scores and NER tags.
Our model outperforms several popular summarization models,
and achieves ROUGE-1 F1 score of 0.725.
Besides, the result of online A/B testing shows substantial benefits
of our model in real online shopping scenario.
Possible future works include handling similar terms
that appear in the short titles generated by our model.
Besides, we also try to
combine sentence compression/simplification with image captioning, which may lead to the design of a very innovative system that can better understand and display online products to users.
