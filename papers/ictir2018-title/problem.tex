\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problem}

In this section we formally define the problem of short title extraction.
A char is a single Chinese or English character.
A segmented word (or term) $x$ is a sequence of several chars such as 
``Nike'' or ``牛仔裤''(jean).
A product title, denoted as $X$, is a sequence of words $\{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$.
Let $Y$ be a sequence of labels $\{y_1, y_2, ..., y_n\}$ over $X$, where $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$.
The corresponding short title is a subsequence of $X$, denoted as $S = \{x_i\}$, 
where $y_i = 1$ and $|S| \le n$.

%we are interesting in obtaining a short title which can represent the most important information about the product.

We regard short title extraction task as a sequence classification problem.
Each word is sequentially visited in the original product title order
and a binary decision is made.
We do this by scoring each word $x_i$ within $X$ and predicting a label $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$, 
indicating whether the word should or should not be included in the short title $S$.
As we apply supervised training, the objective is to maximize the likelihood of all word labels
$Y=\{y_1,y_2,...,y_n\}$, given the input product title $X$ and model parameters $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:problem}
\log{p(Y|X,\theta)}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\log{p(y_i|X,\theta)}}.
\end{equation}

%Our problem is different from Sequece Labelling problem, as ...

%In a more restrictive scenario, the number of words $m$ in the short title is strictly limited, where $m$ is some fixed number and $m \le \sum_{i=1}^{n} len(x_i)$. $len(x_i)$ is the number of words (chars) in term $x_i$.
