\begin{abstract}

%Protecting the copyrights of intelligent electric products is an urgent task around the world. One way to deter piracy
%of these products is to make illegal copying very difficult or impossible by approaches such as encryption. A complimentary 
%approach is to embed digital watermarks into the electric products.
%Digital road maps are a valuable resource for GPS navigation and other GIS applications. 
%It is a form of vector graphics but with spatial-geometric properties.
%Watermarking is an important mechanism to protect the copyright of digital
%road maps.  
Past research on watermarking digital road maps has been focused on
deterring common attacks such as adding noise to the whole map so as to
destroy the embedded watermarks. This paper focuses on two less common but
increasingly used types of attack: crop attacks and merge attacks. 
Crop attack crops a fragment of the original map and uses the fragment as a new
map. When the new map is much smaller than the original map, it is called
massive cropping. Merge attack merges maps from various sources together
to form a new map. 
Conventional watermarking techniques fail against these attacks
either because they require global information from the whole map or
they must add too many local watermarks and affect the usability of the maps.
%these two types of attacks totally because they detect waterwarks based on
%global information from the whole map, or they must divide the map into many small
%segments and add many more watermarks locally and thus affect the perception
%and usability of the maps. 
This paper proposes a novel quad-tree based
blind watermarking scheme that partitions the original map according to
the quad-tree and plants just one single bit in each sub-region of the
map. The approach achieves almost 100\% detection accuracy for moderate
crop and merge attacks, and over 80\% accuracy with more than 95\% of the 
original map cropped and removed. Furthermore, the method introduces 
very little distortion to the original map: 
to effectively protect a 23.5MB Minneapolis-St.Paul map against
crop and merge as well as other common attacks, only
423 bits or 53 bytes of watermark is required.

%In this research, we analyse the properties of digital road maps and propose
%a novel blind watermarking framework to protect the IP rights of owners of
%the maps.
%The framework makes use of local information which is collected by a 
%modified Quadtree structure and inserts watermarks according to the density of
%the map. The framework also allows the detection of the illegal use of a
%watermarked map without reference to the original map at all.
%The most important advantage of this framework is that it detects illegal
%use of even a small part of a protected map, in what we call ``massive crop attacks'' 
%and ``merge attacks'', which were previously unsolved problems. 
%The evaluation shows that our approach offers high accuracy with very reasonable
%time complexity.
%
%\KZ{Key points: Traditional watermarking techniques don't handle cropping and
%merging attacks well and they incur bigger distortion to the maps. We are 1) blind;
%2) light-weight (nlogn); 3) limited distortion (only a number of bits are changed);
%4) localized watermarks that can handle massive cropping and merging attacks.}
