\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed some new syntaxes that can be embedded with HDLs, and a precompiler that translates these syntaxes into HDL. Designer could benefit from SV+ in terms of easy modularization design, area-time optimization and code reuse, since SV+ can interactive with usres and do module schedule to gain various configurations. SV+ system has good expandability. More re-configurable structures can be explored and expressed with new syntaxes.
With a more powerful SV+ system, users could describe circuit in mathematical or algorithms level.
