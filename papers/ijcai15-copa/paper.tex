%\ZY{hi}
This paper studies the problem of commonsense causal reasoning. We
propose a framework to automatically harvest a network of
causal-effect terms from a web corpus. We then encode a causal
direction and strength on the network based on lexico-syntactic
analysis of sentences. Based on this network, we propose an
algorithm to detect events from sentences and compute the causal
strength between events. We validate our framework using SEMEVAL
benchmark called COPA, outperforming all the reported results of
existing state-of-the-arts.
