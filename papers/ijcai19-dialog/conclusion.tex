\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we focus on identifying QA pairs in two-party multi-turn online dialogues based on utterances with Q or NQ labels. Our proposed models achieve the best overall accuracy with highest quality QA pairs. We also discuss the effectiveness of models for Q-NQ pairs with variable distances and IQA matching accuracy. Both results show that our models are significantly better than previous methods. In the future, we are going to focus more on IQA matching. Taking domain knowledge and common sense knowledge into consideration is another research direction for utterances matching task.
