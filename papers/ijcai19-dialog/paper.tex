\begin{abstract}
Question motivated multi-turn dialogues, such as those between doctors and patients in online discussion forums, are rich in question-answer pairs. These QA pairs are valuable for researches on proactive questioning and dialogue comprehension. However, these real-world online dialogues are often noisy and disordered, and mixed up with questions, answers and chit chats, making it difficult to extract high quality QA pairs. In this work, the proposed pairwise matching models combine the dialogue history in an interleaving way with two parallel attention mechanisms. Experiments show that our models achieve the best results, and are significantly better than previous methods on identifying long-distance QA pairs.
%This paper focus on matching between questions and non questions in 
%two-party multi-turn dialogs. 
%It's not only a way to get more training data for dialog systems and 
%help with research on proactive questioning, but also used for dialog 
%comprehension. 
%In this way, our models are able to match answers for questions from both speakers and solve the different disorder situations in a unified manner.
