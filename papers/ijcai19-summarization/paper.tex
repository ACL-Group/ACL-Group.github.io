\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Convolutional sequence to sequence (CNN seq2seq) models
have met great success in abstractive summarization. 
However, their outputs often contain repetitive word sequences and logical
inconsistencies, limiting the practicality of their application.
%It is important for CNN seq2seq model to get the ability to 
%generate summaries without repetition in abstractive summarization. 
In this paper, we propose to reduce the repetition in output summaries
by dynamically redistributing attention over the input sequence as
the output sentences are generated.
The results show that this approach 
generates high-quality summaries with vitually no repetition, 
and outperforms the baselines consistently in terms of
ROUGE score, repeatedness, and correctness.
