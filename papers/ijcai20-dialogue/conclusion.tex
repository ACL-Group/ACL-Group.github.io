\section{Conclusion}
As far as we know, we are the first work bringing the dependency information of 
dialogue into multi-turn response selection task. We proposed the dialogue extraction algorithm 
and Thread-Encoder model, which becomes the state-of-the-art on several well-known 
ubuntu datasets. In the future, we will move on to develop more general 
dialogue dependency parser and better incorporate dependency information into 
dialogue context modeling tasks.
