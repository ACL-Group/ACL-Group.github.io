\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Multi-turn response selection is a task designed for developing dialogue agents. The performance on this task has a remarkable improvement with the emergence of pretrained language models. However, these models simply concatenate the turns in dialogue history as the input and largely ignored the dependencies between the turns. In this paper,  we propose a dialogue extraction algorithm to transform a dialogue history into threads based on the dependency relations. Each thread can be regarded as a self-contained sub-dialogue. We also propose Thread-Encoder model to encode threads and candidates into compact
representations by pretrained Transformers and finally get the matching score through an attention layer. The experiments show that dependency relations are helpful for dialogue context understanding, and our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both DSTC7 and DSTC8, with competitive results on UbuntuV2.
