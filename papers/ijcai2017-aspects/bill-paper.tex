\title{Representing Cross-cultural Bilingual Terms by Socio-linguistic Features}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract} 
Capturing cultural differences is an important challenge in bilingual text understanding
or machine translation. This paper presents a novel framework for obtaining cross-lingual 
term representations by mining sociolinguistic features from online social media. 
Such representations can act as a building block for computational social science tasks. 
We evaluated our framework on two such tasks: detection of cultural differences in named entities
and extraction of bilingual lexicon for online slangs. Results shows that the proposed 
socio-linguistic representation outperforms a number of baseline methods by substantial
margins.
