                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>The paper addresses the problem of inferring knowledge base representations that can be used to enrich and complete existing large knowledge bases such as DBpedia. It proposes an approach for inferring representation schemas as graph substructures (e.g., trees) that capture natural language relations. These schemas can then be used to generate new triple relations in existing KBs. The underlying idea is that rules can be represented in a graph KB as sub-structures linking nodes in the KB representing entities already existing in the KB. So natural language relations can be seen as schemas in a knowledge base. Learning these new relations is then performed by a process of learning the probability distribution over schemas to identify the most likely schema that would capture new natural language relations. Evaluation results show that the approach can outperform existing link prediction methods. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This is a nice paper that provides a novel contribution to the problem of knowledge base completion. The approach is clearly described and results evaluated with respect to some of the key existing methods. There are, however, some specific comments that I would like the authors to further clarify in the paper:</p><p><br></p><p>1) The challenges of the KBC that they are taking is well formalised. However, it seems to me that the approach of learning new relations through equivalent subgraph mining may have some limitation in the expressivity of the relations that are learned. For instance, what about if the relation to learn have some negated dependencies with respect to existing primitive relations in the KB? How could such an approach be extended to cover relation definitions that include negated conditions in the graph structured?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2) On page 3, it is not clear where the conditional independence assumption of the Bayesian rule is applied. It seems to me that some dependency on the conditional probabilities with respect to the sc_{j} that are in a specific path of a given schema s should exist. So, what is truly conditionally independent? The authors should clarify this point further.</p><p><br></p><p>3) The evaluation has been carried out under the assumption of mining paths that have a length up to 3. Why not considering longer paths and what is the cause of such upper bound? Is it a scalability issue (i.e. computationally harder problem) or a intrinsic limitation of the approach itself in not been able to discriminating nonsensical schemas from the most likely ones when the length is bigger than 3? The authors should add further comments on whether/how this limit could be lifted, if and when necessary.</p><p><br></p><p>4) Finally, it is not clear how the value of the threshold \gamma is defined</p><p><br></p><p>Overall I enjoyed reading this paper. Some typos are listed below:</p><p><br></p><p>Typos:</p><p><br></p><p>1) Definition2: “Denoted by” —&gt; “denoted by”</p><p>2) page 3: “3&nbsp; million the” —&gt; “3 million”</p><p>3) page 6: “the the search” —&gt; “the search”</p> </li>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>This paper proposes an approach to building tree based formal representation for natural language relations, which is an important task. It is a two-step procedure: search based heuristics to generate candidate schemas and then data driven inference by maximum likelihood estimation to select most possible schemas. The authors claim that this is a promising approach compared to previous techniques, including embedding based and inductive rule based approaches. However, I am not totally convinced due to two facts. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear comparison with the embedding techniques and rule based induction techniques in terms of models. Secondly, the empirical comparisons are not well designed in terms of datasets and settings. For example, the conclusions are drew either based on four examples or based on different datasets from those used in the related work. Moreover, the hyperparameters are not specified for each system used in the evaluation.<br><br>Detailed comments:<br>&nbsp;<br>In the introduction part, the authors claim that embedding techniques need more training data but also say that they are not scale to a large KB. This sentence seems to be ambiguous. For the training data FB3M, it has 3 million entities and 50 million triples constructed by the authors. Does that mean embedding techniques won’t work even when the training data is this big? Moreover, although the dataset FB15k consists of just 14951 entities, but it has been used in one of the embedding based techniques [Bordes et. al 2013]. A more reasonable explanation is required to clarify why the proposed model is favored regarding the state-of-art approaches. <br><br>The Algorithm 1 has certain concerns to be addressed: <br>Values of S,Q,B and Minimum support ratio are not initialized. <br>Line 3 - return Q? What is the value?<br>Is SchemaExpansion () a function? If not, what is it? If yes, what does it do?<br><br><br>Section 3.2: Formula 1 seems to be written wrong. Why is a probability of subject|object&nbsp; multiplied twice? Should there be a object|subject in the second probability distribution ?<br><br><br>Experiments:<br><br>Experimental setup section is badly written. It is very hard to differentiate between “PATTY-100” and “PATTY+-100” and other similar names. The authors could have represented them in the form of a table rather than explaining the statistics in text.<br><br>Section 4.2 <br>The main contribution of the paper is to create better schemas in the KBs with complex semantics, hence this section should be the highlight.<br>But the evaluation based on four examples as shown in the Figure 3 does not seem to be a good evaluation metric for evaluating the approach.&nbsp; Why these four relations are chosen? Does the conclusion drew on the four examples can be generalized? Although there might be no benchmark for this task, I think it is necessary to perform a numerical evaluation over a large number of relations to compare with AMIE+ and SFE. <br><br>Moreover, human judgement evaluations should be unbiased. Hence people from out of the domain could better evaluate this rather than people who work on this domain. The authors have not mentioned the human bias factor in this regard. Do the evaluators come from outside the domain? Or the authors themselves manually evaluated this? <br><br>Section 4.3 &amp; 4.4<br>KALE system [Guo et.al 2016] is evaluated on two corpus which are WN18 and FB122, whereas the authors of this paper evaluate it on PATTY 100 and FB15K-37 datasets. Unless there is an evaluation done on the same dataset or at least one of the dataset, it is hard to rely on the results of two different datasets to compare different systems. Moreover, the authors forget to detail their hyperparameters that produced the reported results, which makes it impossible for others to reconstruct the same experimental setting for future evaluations.<br><br>Suggestion: evaluate your approach on the datasets used by KALE. A comparison on a common dataset as used by existing approaches shall make the evaluation fair. In any case, the authors should list the parameters or experiment settings from the related works used on their datasets and evaluate in the exact same setting on the dataset constructed by the authors. This is to verify if those approaches fail on this data with their best settings. If it is, that means the proposed approach outperforms others on this new data. Together with the evaluations on common datasets will make the evaluation reliable. Moreover, it is necessary to describe the choice of the range of minimum support and smoothing parameters used to produce the final results shown at the end of section 4.3 and section 4.4. And it would be good for the community working in this domain if the code is made public with the setting to reproduce the experiments. <br><br><br>Section 5 <br>Related work needs to be clear in comparing with embedding based and rule induction methods. Paragraph two mentions a criterion which is never explained or detailed.<br></p> </li>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>This paper proposes a way to infer a representation of a knowledge base from (unstructured) natural language text. &nbsp;It seems that the authors wish to infer a semantic net for a given set of documents.&nbsp;</p><p>Link prediction and triple classification appears to be an area with a lot of interest in. In particular using the standard data-set FB15K. Thus, it is not clear to me, when state-of-the-art was gathered, or whether it is complete. I always miss a method description as to how SotA was gathered. I just happened to read this paper:&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.05488.pdf.">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.05488.pdf</a>, and on the surface, at least, it seems to outperform on the link prediction task.</p> </li>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>This paper mines the equivalence between natural language
relations and structured knowledge known as schemas. It generalizes previous approaches of rule induction techniques based on simple path representation by adding constraints
along the path and thus support more complex semantics.&nbsp;</p><p>The observation of the authors that the approach benefits from increasing amount of training
data, but is sensitive to the noisy pairs in the input, is not surprising at all.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The paper addresses a relevant and important topic and is very well-written and easy to follow. The results are nice, and are properly evaluated. Overall, I liked the approach, and enjoyed reading this paper.</p> </li>
