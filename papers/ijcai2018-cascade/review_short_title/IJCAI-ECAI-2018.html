<br></p><p><span>This paper studies the problem of automatically
generating a short title from a manually written longer description of
E-commerce products for display on mobile devices. It proposed a
feature-enriched network model, combining three different categories of
features. The problem is interesting and the paper is generally easy to follow.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>It is claimed in the paper that “to the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt that attacks the E-commerce product short
title extraction problem”, however, this paper is not the first attempt, some
papers studying the same problem has been published, for example:</span></p><p>

<br></p><p><span>Wang et al., A Multi-task Learning Approach for
Improving Product Title Compression with User Search Log Data. In AAAI 2018. </span></p><p>

<br></p><p><span>The proposed neural network model for addressing the
problem is very simple extension of traditional attentional RNN-based sequence
labeling models by incorporating some traditional features in very straightforward
way. The novelty of the proposed model is very limited. </span></p><p>

<br></p><p><span>The evaluation dataset is automatically crawled from
the e-commerce website, including the short answers. How do you guarantee that
the short titles in the web sites are truly labeled by human annotators, but
not automatically generated by some AI algorithms? </span></p><p>

<br></p><p><span>Since the problem addressed in this paper is actually
a special case of sentence compression or sentence summarization. Many advanced
models have been proposed for addressing the sentence compression or sentence summarization
problem, so more advanced models need to be compared in the experiments. </span></p><p>

<br></p><p><span>It is not clear about the influence of the different
kinds of features used in the model. Ablation tests are needed to test the
usefulness of the features. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>The paper presents a system that can summarize titles af article in e-commerce website to shorter titles that can more easily be displayed on mobile devices. This is an interesting use case to sentence compression (and not text summarization).    </p><p><br></p><p>I find the comparison, in section 5, of the authors' system with other system is not convincing. In fact the authors first focused on text summarization, and then, in section 6 they adequately mention sentence compression. Indeed, this work is more relevant to sentence compression or also sentence simplification (which is not mentioned in the paper) rather than text summarization. So I would have found it more relevant if the authors compared their system with, for example, tools such as those presented in articles like:  </p><p>Trevor Cohn, Mirella Lapata, An abstractive approach to sentence compression, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 4(3): 41:1-41:35, 2013.  </p><p>Xingxing Zhang, Mirella Lapata, Sentence Simplification with Deep Reinforcement Learning, Processings EMNLP 2017, pp.584-594, 2017. </p><p>Also there is an interesting prototype available here: https://research.googleblog.com/2016/08/text-summarization-with-tensorflow.html that may be of interest for you (it shows how to compress a sentence to a headline). Note that the authors of this blog page use the Annotated English Gigaword (that you did not cite) as a dataset.  </p><p>Currently you tried to used quite classical techniques of text summarization, which is not very innovative for this field. I think an interesting line of research might be to look at the work on automatic image captioning (many papers have also been published in recent years). Combining sentence compression/simplification and image captioning could lead to the design of a very innovative system.   </p><p><br></p><p>In section 5.6 (discussions) it would have been nice to provide more than one example of long/short title. For example it would be interesting to have several examples long/short titles for various (3 or 4) bad and good values of the ROUGE Measure. This might give an indication of why some titles compress well and others not.  </p><p>Section 6 (related work) should focus more on sentence compression and sentence simplification, which are more relevant domains than text summarization.  </p><p>At the end of section 6 you wrote: "Besides, while existing summarization systems focus on news articles or other documents, we are the first to do summarization in a mobile e-commerce setting". ok, but then could you tell us what is the specificity of doing summarization in a mobile e-commerce setting? What makes it different from text summarization on news or documents? </p><p><br></p><p>   In the references, I would prefer you use the references of papers in conference when it's possible rather than arXiv references. For example: </p><p>[Cheng and Lapata, 2016] has been published ar ACL 2016 </p><p>[Luong et al., 2015] has been published at EMNLP 2015 </p><p>[Nallapati et al., 2016] has been published at CoNLL 2016 </p><p>[See et al., 2017] has been published at ACL 2017 </p><p> There is a problem with [Nallapati et al., 2016] (it's written "HiP (yi= 1-hi,si,d)") this paper has been published at AAAI 2017.   </p><p><br></p> </li>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>- This work seeks to solve a specific problem in E-commerce background that long title of items is not proper for mobile app. They regard it as an extractive summarization problem and rely on attention-based recurrent neural network to solve it. I'm afraid this problem and their approach do not seem to be novel enough. </p><p>- They claim the difference with previous methods is they add two extra semantic features (TF-IDF, NER) as a help. It is natural for me to think in the experimental section the results of using these two extra semantic features purely should be compared with your results. But there are no related experimental results.</p><p>- In Section 3, they define "word" in their work as "Nike" or "牛仔裤", which should be moved before Table 1 where "word" is not defined.</p><p>- In Section 4, Equation (3) has "j", but what is "j"? Many denotations do not have an explanation when they appear firstly, for example, "i" in [h_i, h_i], W_d, b_d, b_att.</p><p>- In Section 5.5, they mention the statistics from Double 11 shopping season, which mainly refer to November 11. It is natural for me to think why do they avoid the statistics on or after November&nbsp;11, and just show statistics between November&nbsp;2 and November&nbsp;6? I'm afraid the improvements of sales volume are actually because the big promotion before November 11.</p> </li>

                        <li><h6>Comments to Authors.</h6> <p>This paper studies the problem of extracting words from a
long description to be displayed as a short title to a product in a Chinese
business platform. To tackle the problem, the authors apply a recurrent neural
network, where the “content”, “attention” and “semantic” features are fed into
it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are some main concerns as follows:</p><p>1. There are a huge of text summarization algorithms having
been proposed. However, none of the state-of-the-art summarization algorithms
is compared to validate the effectiveness of their method. The authors need to
take state-of-the-art extractive text summarization algorithms into account for
comparisons in their experiments.</p><p>2. The research problem studied in the paper has been investigated
by other researchers. For instance, the following paper also aimed at summarizing
long product titles to a shorter one to be displayed to the customer in E-commerce
mobile platform:</p><p><span>Jingang Wang et al. A Multi-task Learning
Approach for Improving Product Title Compression with User Search Log Data. In
AAAI, 2018.</span></p><p><span>The authors didn’t take the method proposed in
the above AAAI paper as their baseline and made no discussions between their
model and that in the AAAI paper.</span></p><p>3. Are there other features to be considered and used in
your neural networks?</p><p>4. What are the impact of different categories of the
features to the final summarization performance?</p><p>5. Why not personalize the summarization results? It seems
that different people need to be displayed different summarization results.</p><p>6. How do you generate the ground-truth summarization result
given a long description of a product in your dataset?</p><p>7. The performance of the summarization with various char
lengths needs to be reported in the experiments. The authors need to plot a
figure, where the Rouge scores with m=1, 2, … m(m=12) need to be reported.</p><p>8. In the paper, you apply RNN to tackle the summarization
task. Are there other ways to address the task? What are the motivations to
apply RNN but not other methods to tackle the task?</p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>In sum, the problem has been investigated in the AAAI paper.
However, there is no discussion between the authors’ method and that of the
AAAI paper. The authors are encouraged to make comparison to the method
proposed in the AAAI paper.</span></p><p></p><style>
