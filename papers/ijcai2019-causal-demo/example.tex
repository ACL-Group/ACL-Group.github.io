\section{Example}
\label{sec:example}
A tiny executable example to illustrate causal reasoning with uncertainty is as follows:
Suppose we have a rule base with only rule (1), Zh-Probase and Zh-ConceptNet.
First, given a query sentence: ``Thailand suffered an earthquake attack".
Second, extract the quintuple event: ('',Thailand,suffer,earthquake,attack).
Third, search for the related rules and facts. We can get the only rule and related facts: isA(thailand,country), isA(earthquake,disaster), atLocation(rice,thailand), isA(rice,product).
Fourth, convert them into standard Prolog code.\\
1.isA(thailand,country).\\
2.isA(earthquake,disaster).\\
3.isA(rice,product).\\
4.atLocation(rice,thailand).\\
5.isconfident(X):-X $>$ 0.3. (here, the threshold is 0.3)\\
6.rise(\_,\_,\_,\_,[],\_,[]).\\
7.suffer(-, X, Y, attack, Es, C, Cs):-rise(Z, price, -, -, EIs, CI, CIs), isA(X, country), isA(Y, disaster), isA(Z, product), atLocation(Z, X), is(CI, 0.84*C), isconfident(CI), append(EIs, [rise(Z, price, -, -)], Es), append(CIs, [0.84], Cs).\\
Line 5,6 and `append' predicate in Line 7 are auxiliary code that helps to run in Prolog.
Fifth, query ``suffer(-,thailand,earthquake,attack,Es,1,Cs)." in SWI-Prolog.
Get predicted events with confidences:\\
Es=[rise(rice,price,-,-)],\\
Cs=[0.84];

Thus, we can predict the price of rice will increase with confidence of 0.84 if Thailand suffered an earthquake attack.
Furthermore, if we search for these two related facts: isA(rubber, product),atLocation(rubber, thailand), we can also predict that the price of rubber will rise.

We built a demo to demonstrate the reasoning process at URL: https://adapt.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/intelligentsia/alerts.html.


%We also developed an application demo of futures prices change triggering that can monitor news from around the world in real time, find the news that may cause futures prices changes, and alert users. Visit URL.

\section{Conclusion}
We propose a causal knowledge representation scheme and a tailor-made reasoning system based on Prolog. Reasoning besides causal knowledge and some downstream applications, such as financial futures price prediction,etc., will be explored in the future.
