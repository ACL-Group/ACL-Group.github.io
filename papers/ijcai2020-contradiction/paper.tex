	\maketitle
	\begin{abstract}
		Incorporating commonsense knowledge to machines is a long-standing challenge to fulfill real artificial intelligence. Given that mobile users tend to generate shorter content, we target common sense on short, context-poor phrases, unlike previous researches which mainly focus on commonsense inferences between long contents. With the help of our constructed \textit{Concept Association Graph} which contains abundant web knowledge, we propose a new dataset \textbf{CoCon} with over 9,000 pairs of short Chinese phrases, which is designed for testing the capability of machines on commonsense reasoning. Preliminary experiments show that large pre-trained language models such as BERT and ERNIE are still lagging behind human performance by a large margin on CoCon, which indicates that further efforts are needed to enable machines to grasp such commonsense knowledge.
