\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework for sentence-based relation classification.
In our framework, models not only strive to classify query instances, but also seek underlying knowledge within support instances. %models are trained not only by queries but also the support instances.
The framework also includes a method for aggregating cross-domain knowledge into models by open-source data augmentation.
Additionally, we construct our own dataset: the TinyRel-CM dataset,
a few-shot relation classification dataset in health domain with limited training data.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework brings performance gains for most models, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art results on TinyRel-CM dataset and achieves
competitive results on the FewRel dataset \cite{han-etal-2018-fewrel}, especially when extremely small amount of training data is given.
