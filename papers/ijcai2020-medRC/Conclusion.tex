\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning framework for relation classification that aims to extract information within support instances and using data augmentation. Our methods are extremely powerful under circumstances where limited training data is available.
%MME aims to extract underlying information brought within support sentences. In MME, a supplementary classifier is adopted to classify the relation of each support sentence, and participates in the back propagation progress by a fast-slow learner strategy. We also propose a way of aggregating cross-domain data into the training process. This helps the model to learn underlying cross-domain knowledge. These two innovations are especially useful under circumstances where extremely few data is available.
Additionally, we construct our own dataset, the TinyRel-CM dataset, a Chinese few-shot relation classification dataset in medical domain. The small training data size makes the TinyRel-CM dataset a challenging task.
%Different from previous released few-shot relation classification datasets, the TinyRel-CM dataset contains extremely limited labeled data and provides a much harder few-shot learning task. Our proposed MME framework and data augmentation method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the TinyRel-CM dataset and competitive results on the FewRel dataset.
%As for future work, we aim to extract abundant relation classes and instances from massive open-source data with our proposed MME framework to construct a knowledge base in medical domain .
