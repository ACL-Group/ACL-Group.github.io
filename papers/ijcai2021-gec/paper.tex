\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a modulized architecture for Grammtical error correction (GEC). While recent works target to fine-tune a transformer-based pretrained model for this task, we devide the problem into two and construct correspendant modules, Grammatical Error Tagging and Mask Filling (GET-MF), for each of these two sub-problems. The GET module first predicts the edit tags for each token, the MF module suggests then the tokons regardign to the tags given by the GET module and effectuate the edits. The model achieves competitive accurancy on GEC task while improving the performance on certain types of errors like wrongly used collocations comparing to the state-of-the-art models for two reasons: On one hand, it shrinks the output dimension by optimizing the edit tag; on the other hand, it breaks the limit on the size of the editing space, which restricts vocabulary that can be effectuated for the corrections.
