\section{Conclusion}
% \KZ{Fix this one: no more ``unsupervised''...}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for automatical paraphrase 
generation without parallel training data. It outperforms most existing 
unsupervised and distantly supervised methods. While the results are positive, 
some questions remain. 
Can we find more underlying semantics to represent the input sentence? Can we replace the round-trip translation model with a lighter-weight model? 
We plan to look into these questions in the future and generate better paraphrases.
