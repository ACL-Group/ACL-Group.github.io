\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Pre-trained language models~(PLMs) have significantly advanced a wealth of natural language processing tasks. However, they are computationally expensive and memory intensive for resource-constrained scenarios. 
In this paper, we first present a novel module-based two-branch container
in which layers of a well-trained teacher model and those of the student model are interleaved in a stochastic fashion. Based on this container, we then design a 
two-stage compression framework that allows the student to learn from the teacher 
via implicit collaboration and explicit demonstration. 
We also explore a semi-supervised setup where our framework can benefit from cheap 
data augmentation without task-specific labels. 
Experiments of compressing a 12-layer BERT on five language understanding tasks 
show that our framework can better retain the performance of the teacher model compared 
to other existing techniques.
