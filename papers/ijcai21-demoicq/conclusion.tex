\section{Conclusion}
We propose an automatic visualization tool, 
%ICQ (I-See-Cue),
%but dataset and model independent 
%framework, that evaluates the potential biases and cues in NLI multiple choice 
%datasets and further shed light on
which explores models at least from the perspective of the statistical cues. 
We experimented on a large range of datasets covering different tasks and 
conclude that the new evaluation framework is effective in discovering
bias problems in some popular models.
%and widely applicable. 
% Further research will be
%directed to better ways of de-biasing the dataset and other ways to improve general model 
%robustness.
