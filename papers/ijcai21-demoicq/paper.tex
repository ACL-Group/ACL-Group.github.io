\title{ICQ: Visualizing Statistical Label Biases in Discriminative Text Inference Models}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Recent work has shown that sophisticated neural models may 
take advantage of the label biases in some NLI datasets and 
the model effectiveness may be overrated. 
%However, none of the work has been able to
%easily pinpoint what these cues are. 
%Inspired by black-box test in software engineering, 
%Some human-designed stress tests have been proposed to mitigate this problem
%but they are expensive to create and do not generalize to arbitrary models. 
%\KZ{There seems to be too  much before here.}
We propose a visualization tool, ICQ (I-See-Cue), 
that automatically identifies such biases
in any multiple choice datasets and visually validates
if a model takes advantage of these biases.  Our demo includes 
12 well-known datasets and 3 popular neural models to solve
these tasks for users to try and allows users to upload their own
datasets and models.
