Reviewer #1
Questions

1. Please briefly summarize the main contributions of the paper in your own words. (Please do not include your evaluation of the paper here).
The paper is concerned with learning-based approaches to open-domain multiple-choice question answering. Shortcomings of existing approaches are described and a method for training data augmentation by means of crossover and mutation operations is proposed to improve the performance.
2. What are the main strengths of the paper? Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance and impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility (as specified in our reproducibility guidelines).
Methods for stress-testing existing models are a useful methodological contribution on their own right.
3. What opportunities are there to improve the paper?
Experiments presented in the paper lack a statistical analysis, i.e., it remains unclear which differences are truly the result of altering the experimental conditions. 

The proposed method are straightforward and may introduce acceptable answers labelled as wrong. This makes it unclear whether the methods actually gear learning in MCQ actually more towards reasoning as suggested in the title.
4. What pressing questions do you have for the authors in the rebuttal ? List (and number) only questions about specific issues here that 1) could directly influence your evaluation of the paper, and 2) do not require providing new results. Typical questions include requests to clarify or justify particular issues, or about important relationships to other works.

Was a statistical analysis performed and, if so, which differences are significant?

Can we interpret a performance in he "choice-only" condition that is better than random guess as a sign of a biased dataset?
5. Overall assessment.
Borderline Reject. Marginally below the acceptance threshold. The paper has merits but there are key weaknesses. It would benefit from another revision. Can be rejected. But having it in the program would not be that bad. Please use sparingly.

6. Justify your score in a few lines. Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance, expected impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility.
All in all, I find the study both interesting and acceptable as publication, given the empirical methodology is carried out correctly with proper statistical analysis (all observations hinge on small to moderate difference in the metrics). However, for a paper published at IJCAI I would generally expect it to go beyond the pure observations and investigate the root causes or present and improved method as well. 

The operators are somewhat straightforward and I don't understand why stress test operator PI works as intended. Consider the premisis/answer pairs "He won a prize. He is happy" and "He won a prize. Tom is happy". Clearly, introducing a random person doesn't invalidate the answer. Similar, crossover may introduce a second acceptable answer (like anything relating to happiness in case of the previous example). As for mutation, the answer may be 'less right', but only from language point of view and not in terms of the reasoning required. "Happy Tom is" reminds of Yoda speak but logically just as valid. I am therefore not convinced that these techniques actually foster reasoning in models. 

Related to above remark, I have some general reservations about MCQ for text understanding which I would like to see discussed in the paper. Considering the first example, having an injured back doesn't rule out seeing a psychiatrist and laying down in bed may indeed hurt more than standing. Without further details expressed in premises and answers, I find MCQ to be largely of statistical nature (more often, people stay in bed with a injured back than seeing the psychiatrist). The COPA example in Table 2 is such an extreme case as my door needs to be *pushed* to be locked. 
In order to test reasoning capabilities, I expect that more information should be given, I believe (e.g.,"Because he could stand or walk for more than a few minutes, he staid in bed"). It would be nice if the paper would discuss the utility of MCQ for reasoning in NLP in greater detail. 

minor points:
Figure 1 requires more explanation, the paper should be self-enclosed. What do the bars show, what do the colours mean, and why is there no connection?

page 2: "We apply many stress test (...) many models" To many "many", for my taste. Please use a more objective, technical description.


7. Are the results in this paper easily reproducible ?
CONVINCING : I am convinced that the obtained results can be reproduced, possibly with some effort. Key resources (e.g., proofs, code, data) are already available, will be made available upon acceptance, or good reasons as to why they are not (e.g., proprietary data or code) are reported in the paper. Key details (e.g., proofs, experimental setup) are sufficiently well described but their exact recovery may require some work.
8. Independent of your judgement of the quality of the work, are there any ethical concerns with regard to responsible research or potential negative societal impacts of this submission that must be considered by IJCAI-ECAI 2022 before the paper can be accepted? Papers with a yes here will undergo additional ethical screening by senior members of the program committee. In case of glaring violations of well accepted ethical principles, IJCAI-ECAI 2022 reserves the right to reject the submission. Please check our Ethics Policy in the Call for papers for more details.

Questions

1. Please briefly summarize the main contributions of the paper in your own words. (Please do not include your evaluation of the paper here).
The paper introduces crossover and mutation as two ways for augmenting training data for NLP. This helps creating more robust models and shown by the experimental analysis.
2. What are the main strengths of the paper? Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance and impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility (as specified in our reproducibility guidelines).
The introduce data augmentation operators increase the robustness of the systems.
The paper is relevant of AI, is well written, it is easy to follow and their results are credible.
3. What opportunities are there to improve the paper?
The paper would benefit from some insight on why mutation works.
It seems that most of the time mutation would produce grammatically incorrect answers.

There is a typo in the second paragraph of section 2.1: "perators"

1. Why mutation works?
2. Can the system learn that grammatically incorrect sentences are incorrect answers instead of looking to the premises?

5. Overall assessment.
Clear Accept. Interesting. A very good submission. I learned a lot from this paper. I vote and argue for acceptance. (Top 50% of accepted IJCAI papers.)
6. Justify your score in a few lines. Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance, expected impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility.
The paper is relevant for AI, novel and the results shown significant and credible.

1. Please briefly summarize the main contributions of the paper in your own words. (Please do not include your evaluation of the paper here).
This paper presents a novel approach to augmenting multiple-choice question datasets. The idea is inspired by the genetic algorithm. The paper presents two operators: crossover, which uses the right answers of other questions as the wrong answer for the question being augmented; and mutation, where the right answer for a question is changed in word order and used as the wrong answer.
The data augmentation process is tested on 4 different datasets, with different characteristics. The results show a significant increment of the accuracy wrt training without augmentation. In some cases, the accuracy is higher than that obtained using the back-translation method using the original dataset and is always higher in the stress tests.
2. What are the main strengths of the paper? Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance and impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility (as specified in our reproducibility guidelines).
The presented approach is easy to apply and is able to significantly increase the accuracy in the case of stress tests, ie, when the wrong answers are very similar to the right ones. The mutation forces the model to train on questions with similar answers, in fact, the results obtained in the stress test by this approach are better than those obtained by methods that do not use the mutation. 

These factors make the approach presented in the paper interesting and relevant to AI. However, perhaps the approach is a little too straightforward for IJCAI. On the novelty side, the mutation operation seems very similar in objectives to the stress test operators and makes me wonder what the generated answers look like. Simply swapping the word order would result in sentences with no real meaning, but simply a list of words. Also, why not augment the dataset by using the stress test operators instead of the mutation operator? From what I understand, the goal of the mutation operator is similar to that of the stress test operators.
3. What opportunities are there to improve the paper?
It would be interesting to see an example of question/answer on which one and both the crossover and mutation operators are applied. Moreover, a discussion of the differences between mutation and stress test operators would also be interesting. Also adding training on the augmented dataset using stress test operators to the comparison would improve the strength of the article (but I know this is difficult to ask in this review).

5. Overall assessment.
Borderline Accept. Marginally above the acceptance threshold. Technically correct, but not particularly exciting or inspiring. Could be accepted more or less in its currrent form. Not a big loss if it is not included in the program. Please use sparingly.
6. Justify your score in a few lines. Please focus on novelty, soundness, significance, expected impact, relevance to AI, clarity of exposition, and credibility with regard to reproducibility.

As reported in the strength section, I have some concerns about the mutation operator. I do not know if the system learns to discriminate between well-formed and malformed sentences instead of really using the relationships between premises and answers. Moreover, from Figure 5 there is no dramatic improvement, even though the lines referring to the presented operators are always below the others (although it depends a lot on the base model). It seems, however, that the mutation partly cancels out the effect of the crossover because the +C+M curve is almost always above the +C curve and the +M curve is often paired with the w/o curve.


Minor issues
A the beginning of section 2.1 the reference [Jurafsky er al] is not separated by the word literature
In the caption of figure 4h there is one too many curve brackets
