Below is a WWW TODO list:

1) Combine conceptualization with at least one advanced visual based method,
e.g. Hongtao Lu's method with more sophiscated visual modals.

UPDATE:

2) Speed up the clustering process by reducing time complexity of the context
extraction and wikification (preferably to constants) and find out any
possible performance bugs.

UPDATE:
It turns out that this speed up is very critical to the success of this paper
because if we are going to market this technique as a complemetary thing to
image search, response time is very critical. 
This is our proposal:

Offline: 
step 1:	obtain the context of the image in the web page, by two
	methods:
	(1) starting from the <img> to its sibling and up until there's
	enough text.
	(2) if <img> has an alt text, use it as keyword to find other
	context text in the web page.
	(3) do list extraction to remove unwanted ads, if any.
step 2: wikify (conceptualize) the contexts/url/path into concept vectors
step 3: extract all visual features from the image itself

Online: Just do the tripple clustering itself.
	There are two variants:
	Slower variant: cluster based on the whole context.
	Faster variant: limit the context to a constant size and then cluster.

What is different about this proposal from the current implementation is that
current implementation uses the search term itself, e.g. "kiwi" to
guide the extraction of the context. But in a real offline scenario,
the search term is unknown upfront. So we can't really make use of that.
Kaiqi, please compare the end-to-end results between using the search
term and the proposal above to see if it's feasible to do it without
using the search term.

3) More thorough comparison against other state-of-the-art techniques.

UPDATE:

4) Implement the Probase as a substitute for Wikification. (low pri)

UPDATE:

5) Improve online demo so that it returns all context concepts and handles
user-input queries smoothly and within reasonable time. This includes
downloading images from BING/Baidu instead of Google. (low pri)

UPDATE:

6) Design experiments
