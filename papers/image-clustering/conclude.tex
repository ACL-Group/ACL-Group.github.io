\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework to cluster web images by their
context as well as their visual signals. The novelty lies in that
our framework seeks to ``understand'' the context by converting words
and phrases in the context into high level concepts in an external knowledge
base such as Wikipedia. Moreover, it performs a tri-stage modified HAC clustering,
and brings in the complementary
visual signals which helps when there isn't enough textual signals. Our experiments
show that on 20 ``ambiguous'' query terms, the purity, F-measure and NMI
of our clustering results are
consistently better than other recently developed image clustering systems.
Our prototype system is also practical as it is able to cluster 100 images
within 1 second.
