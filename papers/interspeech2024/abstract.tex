    This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the possible correlation 
    between domestic dog barking voices and their human host's
    language environment.
    We first present a new dataset of Shiba Inu dog barks from YouTube, which 
    provides clean dog barking sound clips, including their contextual information
    of these barks and their owner's speech clips with a carefully-designed pipeline.
    The contextual information includes the scene category of
    the barking sound in the original
    video recording, the dog's location and activity. 
    With a classification task and prominent factor analysis, 
    we discover significant acoustic differences in the dog barks from the 
    two language environments. We further identify some acoustic features from 
    dog barks that are potentially correlated to their host language patterns.
