\opening{Dear Dr. Jim Jansen and Dr. Ian Ruthven,} 

Thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to revise our manuscript, 
we appreciate editor and reviewers very much for their positive and constructive comments and suggestions 
on our manuscript entitled ``Reducing Repetition in Convolutional Abstractive Summarization''.
In this paper, we propose a section-aware attention mechanism (ATTF) and a sentence-level backtracking decoder (SBD)
to reduce the repetition in CNN-based abstractive summarization.

We have studied reviewer's comments carefully and provide detailed response in the uploaded file ``Response to Reviewers''. 
We have tried our best to revise our manuscript according to the comments 
and have made revision which marked in red or blue in the uploaded file ``Revised Manuscript with Changes Marks''. 

We would like to express our great appreciation to you and reviewers for comments on our manuscript. 
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your consideration!

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
