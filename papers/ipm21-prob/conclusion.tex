\section{Conclusion}
We developed a light-weight 
%but dataset and model independent 
framework that evaluates the
potential biases and information leaks in NLU-related multiple choice datasets and further shed light on
the robustness of models at least from the perspective of the statistical cues. 
We experimented on a large range of datasets covering different tasks and conclude that
the new evaluation framework is effective.
%and widely applicable. 
 Further research will be
directed to better ways of de-biasing the dataset and other ways to improve general model 
robustness.
