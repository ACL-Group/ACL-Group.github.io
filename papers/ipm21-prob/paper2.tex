\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Recent work has identified
that many natural language understanding and reasoning datasets contain statistical cues that
may be taken advantaged of by sophisticated models and hence overestimate the 
capability of these models.
Some human-designed stress tests have been proposed to mitigate this problem
but they are expensive to create and do not generalize to arbitrary
models. We propose a light-weight framework to automatically identify possible biases
from any NLU-related multiple-choice datasets and further evaluate 
the robustness of any models targeting the datasets. 
The framework is dataset and model independent. Additionally, it has
the potential of filtering given biased training data to help train a more
robust model.
