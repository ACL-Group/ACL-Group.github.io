%  In the age of information explosion, search engines have been an
%  essential tool in people's daily life and query suggestion is one
%  of most useful feature for a standard search engine. However, because
%  most of search engines are keyword-based, many fantastic features would
%  fail when facing concept-based queries, so does query suggestion. In this
%  paper, we propose a framework so that search engines can give acceptable
%  suggestions when facing concept-based queries.

\begin{abstract}
  A class of search queries which contain abstract concepts are studied in
this paper. These queries cannot be correctly interpreted by traditional keyword-based search engines.
  This paper presents a simple framework that detects and instantiates the
abstract concepts by their concrete entities or meanings to produce alternate
queries that yield better search results.
