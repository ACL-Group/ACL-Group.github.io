\section{Probase - A Probabilistic Taxonomic Knowledge Base}\label{sec:probase}
Probase \cite{wu2012probase} is a probabilistic taxonomic knowledge base with scores, built by
extracting pairs of \textit{isA} relationship of concept-instance pair
from web pages. The taxonomy of Probase helps us to understand queries by recognizing the concepts in them. 
Besides the taxonomy, another value that interests us is
the \textit{typicality} value, which tells us how strong the relation is
between a concept and an instance. 

%We take use of this value as one
%of the components to measure the relevancy between the concepts in
%user query and the instances found in queries from query log. The
%value is derived as:
%\[Typicality\textnormal{-}value(i, c) = \frac{n(i, c)}{n(c)+\alpha}\]
%where $i$ is an instance and $c$ is a concept. The $n(i,c)$ is the
%frequency of the occurrence of instance $i$ and concept $c$ together
%in extracted pairs from web pages, and $n(c)$ is the frequency of the
%occurrence of concept $c$ in all pairs. The value $\alpha$ is used
%to smooth the score and to avoid the high typicality value of a
%concept $c$ that only have one instance $i$, which can be harmful
%if the relationship is supposed to be small.
