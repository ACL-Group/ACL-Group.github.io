\section{Our Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

%Our traffic prediction approach involves 3 major stages: i) integrating
%the map and live traffic data from Baidu Map into OSM; ii) feature engineering;
%and iii) prediction model training. 

In this section, we will
give preliminaries about OSM and Baidu Map and then present the three
stages of our approach in detail. Plus, we showcase a demo at the end.
