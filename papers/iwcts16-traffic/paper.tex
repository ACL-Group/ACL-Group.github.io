% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.


\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).

% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

\begin{abstract}
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a free, open-source and popular mapping service. 
However, due to various reasons, it doesn't offer live 
traffic information or traffic prediction for China. This paper presents an approach and a
system to 
learn a prediction model from graphical
traffic condition data provided by Baidu Map, which is a 
commercial, close-source map provider in China, and 
apply the model on OSM so that one can predict the traffic conditions 
with nearly 90\% accuracy in various parts of Shanghai, China, 
even though no traffic data is available for that area from
Baidu Map. This novel system can be useful in urban planning, 
transportation dispatching as well as personal travel planning.~\footnote{Kenny Q. Zhu is the corresponding author and is supported by
NSFC Grant No. 61373031.}

%We try to solve the traffic prediction in urban planning by achieving two tasks in this thesis, one is the machine learning algorithms that extract the features, train the model and predict the traffic situation with given input features; while the another is the implementation of a backend system and web application that enables user to edit and browse the map while predict and visualize the prediction result as an extra layer on original map. We introduced various type of data sources we use, like OpenStreetMap that is freely and publicly available or the Baidu Map's real-time traffic and POI data that require crawling, parsing and decoding raster image geospatial data. Next we discussed our general thoughts about feature engineering and stated three types of features used for prediction. We designed methods to reference external data sources about location popularity and uses Affinity Propagation clustering and A* routing algorithms while extracting non-local features. Then our model selection comparison and training, testing and evaluation process is introduced. We use multi-class linear SVM classifier. We acheived an overall accuracy of 87\%, nearly 4\% higher than Baidu Map traffic prediction in comparison test. Finally, we go through the design and implementation details of our prediction system from the backend to the demo interface. We also show that our feature and model as well as the system is capable of predicting future traffic at a good accuracy with road network, points of interest and other spatial data, along with temporal and other related non-spatial data as input.
