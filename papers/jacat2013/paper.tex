\title{A Template Based and Interactive AES Generator}
%%%%
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A template based AES\cite{AES} generator was proposed in this work. We explored a new language construction to describe the reconfigurable components of the AES circuit. A precompiler could parse the language constructions been used in the template, and then translates them into Verilog code depending on the user's inputs during the interactive compiling process. Thus, users can gain tradeoffs between area and time easily, without changing any code. Circuits generated by this system vary in architecture as well as in resource consuming and time cost. In our experiments, 15 implements were obtained under $180_{MHz}$ frequency from the template, by using the TSMC $0.18um$ library. Comparing with the low-cost implementation\cite{Yibo:AES}, the maximum throughput is two times higher, and the minimum area is decreased by $20\%$.
