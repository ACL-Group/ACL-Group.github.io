\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we proposed a partial suppression framework for
$\rho$-uncertainty privacy protection. Previous approaches such as
Global  or TDControl both delete more items to satisfy the same privacy model. We developed two heuristics which produce anonymized data that is highly useful to data analytics applications.
We compared these methods with state-of-the-art anonymization techniques
in different aspects such as information loss, data distribution preservation, and rule preservation, and the experiments showed that
\begin{enumerate}
\item First heuristic can effectively limit suprious rules while
maximally preserving the useful rules mineable.
\item Second heuristic which minimizes the K-L divergence between the
anonymized data and the original data helps preserve the data distribution,
which is a feature many works employed since Kifer et al \cite{Kifer:l-diversity} firstly used them.
\end{enumerate}
We also studied empirically the effects of partial suppression parameters
on the information loss and time performance.
This can be used as a general guidance of how to apply the presented framework to other kinds of datasets that are not covered in the experiments. Finally the divide-and-conquer strategy that we proposed in 
Section \nameref{algo:impmentation}
effectively controls the execution time with limited compromise in the solution quality.
