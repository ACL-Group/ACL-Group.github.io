\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we propose to automatically extract a Chinese 
concept association network from three largest Chinese online
encyclopedias, namely Wikipedia, Baidu Encyclopedia and Hudong 
Encyclopedia. 
This network includes two kinds of co-occurrence
information which can be used to mimic how human drift their mind
from one concept to another. Even though the corpus we use is not
the biggest in the world, we have shown that by inferring along paths
in this network, one can discover associations between terms which are
not available using conventional co-occurrences. Such mind drifting process
is particular useful to the ``cold start'' problem in recommendation
systems when the amount of information about a user is small. 
In future, we will consider implementing similar systems for other languages.
We would like to study how different languages and cultures influence
the concept association process and therefore induce different association
network and hence different association behaviors.
