To-do list:
1. Revise our HMM (done)
2. Find applications and evaluation methods for the path (kailang)
	profile expansion vs. path explanation
	when we expand:
	i) which terms to expand
	ii) how to expand, minimum spanning tree, cluster of graphs?
	ii) how to rank or score the expanded terms
3. tradeoff: (keyang)
   size vs. quality 
   num of contexts vs. quality
   size vs. num of contexts
4. try to improve the efficiency of our algorithm (done, keyang)
5. check our data and try to conduct experiments on larger co-occurrence map (ongoing)
6. Disambiguate different concepts under the same page and re-calculate the co-occurrence under different contexts (kailang)
7. Fix those grammatical mistakes, and revise sec.2(Data source part) and sec.3(HMM part) of our paper (ongoing, kailang)
