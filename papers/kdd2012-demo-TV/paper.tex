\begin{abstract}
With 112 channels and about 30,000 programs to watch every week, 
television viewers in China are overwhelmed
with choices. Finding out what to watch, and what not to watch, can be
a time-consuming and frustrating process. 
We deploy a system that
leverages individuals' viewing behavior and the useful information
about the TV programs to make real-time, dynamic
program recommendations to the TV viewers. The system builds a 
vector-space based preference model for each user by 
combining the viewing patterns and the content of the programs viewed. 
Recommendation of future programs is done by selecting the 
best set of programs that matches the user's viewing model.
