Figure \ref{fig:sys} shows the block diagram of our system.
As the input of the system, the web page is first parsed by 
a HTML parser\cite{winista} to obtain a complete DOM representation.
Then the title classifier attempts to recognize the page title.
If it is a ``top-$k$ like'' title, 
the classifier outputs the list size (the number $k$) 
and a set of possible concepts mentioned in the title.
With the number $k$, the candidate picker extracts all lists of size $k$ 
from the page body as candidate lists. Only one of them will be the actual
list of interest. With the concept set, 
the top-$k$ ranker can score each candidate list and pick the best one 
as the ``top-$k$'' list.  Finally the content processor  
analyzes the list content and extracts the entity names and attributes. 
%and conceptualize the main entities in the list
%as well as their attributes, if any.
