Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions.

"The main thrust of the paper is not well described. Even reading the title 
I was misled ..." 

The title reflects the problem we study and seek to solve in this paper.
We agree that the causal knowledge acquisition is one of our major contributions 
and will strengthen its description in the revised version.

"simple PMI ... In this sense, the paper would benefit tremendously from ... 
the derivation of the used metrics does not really rule out plenty of 
other methods at all."

As shown in the experiments, Gordon's PMI method, albeit simple, 
is really effective for the COPA task. We compared our method with all published methods 
as well as other reasonable measures (e.g., Concept Net and conditional probability in
Table 3 and 4) we could think of. We will consider more experimentation with 
different knowledge acquisition measures as future work.

*** The insight into what works ...
Using acquired causal knowledge (CausalNet), our CS metric combines two 
major components in the causal relation, namely necessity causality and 
sufficiency causality, which can be interpreted as the different directions of 
penalized conditional probability.  This metric is straightforward and makes 
use of large text corpus as shown in our experiments.
