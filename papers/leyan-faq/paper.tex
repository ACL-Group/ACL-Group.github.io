\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Aspect-based question-answer pairs generation aims at generating the 
meaningful and interesting question-answer pairs from a document and 
a specific angle. 
This is a brand new problem and no existing methods or datasets are designed specifically for this problem. 
This problem is particularly useful for automatically generating
FAQs from large number of documents. 
In this paper, we create a new dataset for this task and propose
 two frameworks to generate aspect-based question answer pairs.
One is the three-step pipeline framework consists of paragraph retrieval, answer extraction and question generation,
and the other is the filtering framework which remains the QA pairs relevant to aspect keywords after generation.
We demonstrate that aspect can guide to generate the QA pairs to show some point of view. 

%One of the solutions, which jointly models
%the answer span detection and question generation, yields 
%substantially better results than other alternatives.
%Different from the traditional pipeline methods which extract the QA pairs in two-stage,  we propose a joint architecture named AspectQAG to generate QA pairs from the document as prompted.
%The results show that this approach outperforms the pipeline methods substantially by our new defined metric which can evaluate the entirety of a QA pair.
