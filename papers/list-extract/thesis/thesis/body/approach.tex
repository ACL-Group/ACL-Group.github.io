Figure \ref{fig:sys} shows the block diagram of our system.
%As the input of the system, the web page is first parsed by
%an HTML parser\cite{winista} to obtain a complete DOM representation.
First of all, the title classifier attempts to recognize the page title of the input web page.
If it is a ``top-$k$ like'' title,
the classifier outputs the list size (the number $k$)
and a set of possible concepts mentioned in the title.
With the number $k$, the candidate picker extracts all lists of size $k$
from the page body as candidate lists. Only one of them will be the actual
list of interest. With the concept set,
the top-$k$ ranker can score each candidate list and pick the best one
as the ``top-$k$'' list.  Finally the content processor
normalizes the list content
and conceptualizes the main entities in the list
as well as their attributes, if any.

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows.
First we will talk about title recognition in Section \ref{sec:title},
including generating training material (titles), designing model pattern
and building the title classifier.
Second we will discuss list extraction in Section \ref{sec:extractList}, which consists of
preprocessing, clustering candidate lists , ranking and selecting the ``top-$k$'' list, as well as postprocessing.
In addition, some misc topics in the design of the system will be mentioned at the end of the chapter (Section \ref{sec:additionalTopic}).
