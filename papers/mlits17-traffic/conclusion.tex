\section{Conclusion}
In this paper,
we study a both challenging and significant scenario of traffic prediction, which is to predict the future speed of a given road link but without its historical data. 
We first extracted various spatial features to represent the geographical information of each links together with their temporal features,
and then we design several feature-based transfer prediction models.
Also, we proposed a novel two stage prediction model which clusters the links by their spatial features with regularization of their temporal similarities.
%Experimental results show that our methods can achieve very close performance to models like HAM, without using any historical data of the predicted areas.
