\section{Proposed Feature-based Transfer Learning Models}
Obtaining the above features for link and time,
we first apply several classic machine learning models for regression that are trained on source areas with above-explored spatiotemporal features and then simply predict traffic condition on target areas as a test.
Afterwards, we present a novel transfer learning approach named CTMP.

\textit{Notations:} a prediction query instance about a link $l$ at the time $t$ is denoted as $(l,t)$; 
the spatial feature vector for the link $l$ is denoted as  $s_l$, and the temporal feature vector of the time $t$ being predicted on the link $l$ is denoted as  $t_l$.
The ground truth of the speed is denoted as $v_l[t]$.
