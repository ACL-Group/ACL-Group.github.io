\subsection{Linear Regression Model}
Linear regression (LR) is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable $y$ and one or more explanatory variables denoted $\mathbf x$. 
%The linear regression method is a typical supervised learning method since $\mathbf x$ and $y$ are all known and the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. 
The model can be expressed in the following form:
$y = \mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b$ ,where $w$ and $b$ are the parameters we should learn in order to optimize a particular loss. 
%Many methods can be adopted, such as the gradient descent method, to find the proper parameter of the linear model.
In our case, we regard the $\mathbf x$ for each query instance as the concatenation of the spatial feature $s_l$ and the temporal feature $t_l$. 
Thus, we have $\mathbf{x} = [s_l;t_l]$.
