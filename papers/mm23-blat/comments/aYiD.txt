Thanks to the reviewer for your insightful comments.

About the example of missing event tags: The "Speech" label is not helpful for this case. Although the "Speech" label is annotated correctly here, the performance of each class is calculated **independently** for audio tagging. Then the final result is calculated as the unweighted mean of all classes. Therefore, classes with inaccurate annotations will significantly affect the overall result. In the given example, the class "Speech" is annotated accurately but the class "Female speech" is missing from the annotation. These two classes are treated **independently** in AudioSet so results on AudioSet are not so reliable.
