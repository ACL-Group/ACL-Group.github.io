Thanks to the reviewer for your insightful comments.

1. Concerning Figure 4: This example highlights the issue of missing errors (where occurrences in the audio are not annotated) in the annotation of certain classes, such as "Female speech". It is important to note that the performance of each class is calculated **independently**, resulting in unreliable performance for these classes. Furthermore, the final result, calculated as the unweighted mean across all classes, is also unreliable. This issue has been discussed in reference [20]. To address this problem, we present results on FSD50K, where annotations are more reliable. However, since AudioSet serves as a benchmark, we still include it in the table for reference.
2. Thank you for your comment. We have made the checkpoint available at https://transfer.sh/OLm5zntw6a/contrastive_pretrain_cnn14_bertm.pth. Additionally, we are actively working on making the code and curated data accessible to the public.
