\section{Problem Definition}

%This paper is concerned with the \textit{Probabilistic Trance Inference Problem}, which extended from the TIP problem we proposed in our previous paper \cite{wang2011automatic}. The TIP has some limitations. It assume that people moving under a constant speed, this makes it far from reality. This PTIP using speed distribution to overcome the strong limitation, it has the same accuracy, but it does not have a constant speed assumption.

\noindent{\bf Multi-Object Trajectory Inference Problem} {\bf (MOTIP)}: 
Given a vector map $M = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices with precise
coordinates and $E$ is a set of edges representing road segments, 
a set of moving nodes $N$, their speeds distribution $S$, 
their initial locations $L_0$, 
and a contact history $H$ which is a sequence of triples ($n_i$, $n_j$, $t$),
find the location probability distribution of each node at any time in the past,
that is, the probability of $n_i$ at location $x$, at time $t$.
