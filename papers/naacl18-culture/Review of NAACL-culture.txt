NLP Tasks / Applications Description
Description of the task / application: The paper describes an approach to build a 3rd vector space (SocVec) to represent the cross-cultural differences between a pair of languages in social media. Two tasks are described to prove the validity of the approach: (1) cross-cultural differences towards named entities, and (2) computation of cross-cultural similarities between words.
Strengths: * Very important task, and well motivated. * Clever approach that builds a 3rd vector space.
Weaknesses: * It is claimed that the two introduced tasks are new, however it is also said that (Garimella, 2016) tackled a similar problem differently. It would be good to clarify if they worked on the same tasks. * The experiments are conducted on popular terms, which leaves one wondering if it will perform well for less popular terms.

Strengths: Simple and intuitive method to map words from two or more languages into a common third space.
Weaknesses: The application requires external data sources that may not be available for certain languages.
Impact of NLP Tasks / Applications (1-4):

	Description of Method
Description of the method: Projecting words from separate languages into a common space defined by a set of pivots. In this case pivots are defined by BSL.

Hypotheses? The authors tested hypothesis that their approach outperforms a number of competing methods on word matching and slang matching tasks.
Novelty of the hypotheses? No novelty
Substance of the hypotheses? No issues with empirical evaluation of hypothesis.
Empirical Results: Method
What is the method for testing the hypothesis/es? The authors had two separate sets of experiments. First is inferring matching between word meanings in two languages (such as difference in meaning of "Nagoya" in Chinese and English. Second is matching slang between two languages.
Strengths of the method and results? The results are interesting and seem to show that the proposed method is outperforming competition.
Weaknesses of the method and results? The metrics are not well introduced and explained.

	Description of Data / Resources
Description of the data / resource: For the most part authors are using existing external data sets. However, they also introduce a new data set that was manually labeled, where labelers had to indicate level of similarity between lists of words in English and Chinese. In addition, they hand-generated a small data set of matching slang words in Chinese and English.

	Questions for Authors
The authors present an interesting work on matching words and concepts from two languages (they used Chinese and English). The idea is to use social lexicon to get matching pivot words in both languages, which will be used to generate word embeddings of words from both languages in a common space. First, vectors for matching social words are found, and then for any word in either language its original embedding (e.g., learned by glove or word2vec) is compared to embeddings of social words which then gives a new representation of an original words (e.g., if there are 10 pivots, new representation will be of length 10). The authors use the new embeddings to measure matching between the two languages, as well as to explain slang words.
The papers is relatively nicely written, and reader can understand and follow the ideas easily. However, some parts of the paper should be better explained, especially those related to empirical evaluation. Detailed comments are given below. - The authors should write the paper so that non-Chinese speaking readers can follow completely. E.g., comment in lines 623-626 is not clear for non-speakers. - "confidence" is mentioned in line 268 and 270, but not explained. - Notation could be improved. C_x is already used, when authors introduce C_i as well. Very similar notation meaning different things. - Typos: "Enlish", "similarities them", "entity linking a" - Authors use notation "L" before being introduced. - In footnote 10, it is mentioned that slang words are removed. How? - Explanations in evaluation section could be improved. E.g., it was not super clear to me how EM-JS works, how many top words were found, and similar. Similar holds for other methods. - Moreover, how were numbers in Table 2 found? Correlation between what was computed, how? - What was the mentioned ranking and classification problem? - Why not check slang result manually, there were only 200 of them? - Equation in line 686 is not well explained. What is A and what is B? This needs to be explained much better. - Line 729, "filtering out ordinary words", how was that done?
All in all, interesting work with interesting and simple idea that seems to work. The paper could be written better, some critical parts were skipped and left reader scratching their head.
