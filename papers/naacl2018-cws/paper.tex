%% \section{XML conversion and supported \LaTeX\ packages}

%% Following ACL 2014 we will also we will attempt to automatically convert 
%% your \LaTeX\ source files to publish papers in machine-readable 
%% XML with semantic markup in the ACL Anthology, in addition to the 
%% traditional PDF format.  This will allow us to create, over the next 
%% few years, a growing corpus of scientific text for our own future research, 
%% and picks up on recent initiatives on converting ACL papers from earlier 
%% years to XML. 

%% We encourage you to submit a ZIP file of your \LaTeX\ sources along
%% with the camera-ready version of your paper. We will then convert them
%% to XML automatically, using the LaTeXML tool
%% (\url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML}). LaTeXML has \emph{bindings} for
%% a number of \LaTeX\ packages, including the NAACL-HLT 2018 stylefile. These
%% bindings allow LaTeXML to render the commands from these packages
%% correctly in XML. For best results, we encourage you to use the
%% packages that are officially supported by LaTeXML, listed at
%% \url{http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/manual/included.bindings}
