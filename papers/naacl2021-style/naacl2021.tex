\title{ST$^2$: Small-data Text Style Transfer via Multi-task Meta-Learning}

% Author information can be set in various styles:
% For several authors from the same institution:
% \author{Author 1 \and ... \and Author n \\
%         Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% if the names do not fit well on one line use
%         Author 1 \\ {\bf Author 2} \\ ... \\ {\bf Author n} \\
% For authors from different institutions:
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \And  ... \And
%         Author n \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}
% To start a seperate ``row'' of authors use \AND, as in
% \author{Author 1 \\ Address line \\  ... \\ Address line
%         \AND
%         Author 2 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line \And
%         Author 3 \\ Address line \\ ... \\ Address line}

\author{First Author \\

\begin{abstract}
Text style transfer aims to rephrase a sentence in one style into another style while preserving its semantic content. Due to the lack of parallel training data, most state-of-the-art neural methods resort to an unsupervised paradigm and rely on large-scale data in each domain of interest to sufficiently train the networks. Furthermore, existing methods have been applied to very limited categories of styles such as sentiment and formality. In this work, we adapt meta-learning to transfer between any kind of text styles, including a newly constructed dataset regarding personal writing styles, that are more fine-grained, share less content and have much smaller training data. Experimental results demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art models fail in the few-shot style transfer task, our framework effectively utilizes information from other styles to improve the overall transfer effectiveness.
