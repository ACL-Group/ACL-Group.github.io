\begin{abstract}
Natural Language Inference Generation task aims at generating a text hypothesis 
given a text premise and a logical relation between the two. This task can be used in data augmentation and controllable text generation in practice. 
In this paper, we propose language models with prompt and dynamic demonstration (LM-PDD) to tackle this problem in few-shot settings. 
Our framework outperforms standard fine-tuned models with low 
resource, achieving an average 8\% absolute improvement on SNLI and MNLI 
datasets, and the results on 13 natural language classification tasks also
show that our dynamic demonstration method has good generalizability.
