\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for lightweight text-image retrieval. Experiments on two benchmarks show the effectiveness of each component in the framework and the best performance is achieved when combining them together. It holds the merit of reducing model size and accelerating inference time, making memory/response-sensitive applications more practical.
