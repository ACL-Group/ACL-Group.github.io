\begin{abstract}
Current text-image approaches~(e.g., CLIP) typically adopt dual-encoder architecture 
using pre-trained vision-language representation. 
However, these models still pose non-trivial memory requirements and 
substantial incremental indexing time, which makes them less practical on
mobile devices. In this paper, we present an effective two-stage framework 
to compress large pre-trained dual-encoder for lightweight text-image retrieval. 
The resulting model is smaller~(39\% of the original), 
faster~(1.6x/2.9x for processing image/text respectively), yet performs on par with or better than the original full model on Flickr30K and MSCOCO benchmarks. 
We also open-source an accompanying realistic mobile image search application.\end{abstract}
