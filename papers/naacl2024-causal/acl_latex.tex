\begin{abstract}
Social media is a valuable data source for exploring mental health issues. 
However, previous studies have predominantly focused on the semantic content of these posts, overlooking the importance of their temporal attributes, as well as the evolving nature of mental disorders and symptoms.
%To address such limitations, we introduce causality into mental health analysis. By analyzing chronologically arranged posts, we can investigate the causal connections between diverse factors (e.g., symptoms, life events). These causal pathways can help us attain a more profound comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders. 
In this paper, we study the causality between psychiatric symptoms and life events, 
as well as among different symptoms from social media posts, which leads to better understanding
of the underlying mechanisms of mental disorders. By applying these extracted causality features 
to tasks such as diagnosis point detection and early risk detection of depression, 
we notice considerable performance enhancement. This indicates that causality information 
extracted from social media data can boost the efficacy of mental disorder diagnosis 
and treatment planning.
