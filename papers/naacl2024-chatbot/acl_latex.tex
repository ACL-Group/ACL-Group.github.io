\begin{abstract}
While using chatbots in mental health domain is receiving increasing amount of attention, implementation and evaluation of chatbots in psychiatric diagnostic scenarios remains relatively unexplored.
In this work, we introduce a framework named \texttt{PsyDial} to simulate conversations between psychiatrists and patients for depression diagnosis. To establish this framework, we collaborate with professionals to identify the key objectives of these chatbots, designing task-specific evaluation metrics aligned with these objectives. Moreover, we explore the potential of ChatGPT in powering these chatbots. 
% Human psychiatrists and patients were involoved in the conversations with chatbots.
Experiments shows that our psychiatrist chatbot exhibits higher levels of empathy and diagnostic accuracy than baseline, but still exhibits several limitations when compared to human psychiatrists; our patient chatbot can replicate human-like behaviors, including emotional fluctuations.


% In this work, we focus on exploring the potential of ChatGPT in powering chatbots to simulate psychiatrist and patient for depression diagnosis.
% We collaborate with professionals to identify key objectives of such bots and iteratively develop the dialogue system to closely align with real-world scenarios. 
% Additionally, we design task-specific evaluation metrics, and involve real psychiatrists and patients in diagnostic conversations with the chatbots, collecting their ratings for assessment.
