\section{Limitations}

While our study contributes valuable insights to the evaluation and understanding of LLMs in the context of mental health, it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations that affect the scope and generalizability of our findings.

The benchmark tasks were designed based on existing datasets, and thus, the performance of LLMs is contingent on the characteristics and biases present in those datasets. Addressing the broader diversity of mental health scenarios and cultural contexts might require more comprehensive and diverse datasets.

Our benchmark primarily focuses on specific tasks related to mental health, and the performance may not fully capture the complexities of real-world clinical scenarios. The translation from benchmark tasks to actual clinical applications might require additional considerations.

While our study touches upon the models' limited understanding of empathy and dialogue safety, a more in-depth analysis of these aspects is needed. Understanding the ethical implications and potential risks associated with LLMs in mental health applications requires dedicated research.
