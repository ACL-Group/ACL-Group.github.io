Thanks for reading our responses.
1. Reviewers suggest other datasets. We clarify that this paper aims at summarizing daily dialogues rather than task-oriented ones such as meetings. The latter discusses specific issues and events. Instead daily dialogues cover sporadic topics, and their summaries focus on "who-does-what" storylines. This inspired our method, where the prefix consists of "who" or "who-does".
2. tUAN said that our method produces summaries with "Missing or Redundant" information. We stress that higher Mis and Red in Fig 4 just means our summaries are more different from references. Our human evaluation score is actually better than the others (0.55 vs. 0.43, etc.). Further, tUAN misunderstood CR (lower=more compressed).
3. We will add examples and prefix statistics.
