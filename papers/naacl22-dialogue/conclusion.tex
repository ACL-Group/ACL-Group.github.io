\section{Conclusion}

We propose to post-train dialogue summarization models to enhance their 
cross-format rephrase ability by prefix-guided generation training on 
dialogue-sentence pseudo-paraphrases, and get promising results. 
Creating self-supervised tasks for cross-format post-training and 
incorporating compatible features for downstream fine-tuning are 
plausible future directions.
