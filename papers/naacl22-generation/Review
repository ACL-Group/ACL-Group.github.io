Metareview:
The paper presents work to bridge the gap between dialogue summarization and narrative summarization by rephrasing from dialogues to narratives. The proposed method is tested on the standard DialSum and SAMSum data sets.

Summary Of Reasons To Publish:
Interesting, yet effective approach that yields good results, evaluated on standard data sets.

Summary Of Suggested Revisions:
The suggested revisions are primarily concerned with an extension of the related work and comparison of the proposed method to other available dialogue data sets, such as AMI or ICSI -- for a recent overview on data sets used in the past see Tuggener et al 2021 (EMNLP 2021, Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization). Additionally, more details on the prefix tokens should be given.

Overall Assessment: 3 = There are major points that may be revised
Suggested Venues:
Workshops or tracks focusing on summarization.

Ethical Concerns:
None mentioned by the reviewers, but as a human evaluation was carried out, it would be important to give details on how these annotators were recruited and if they were treated and payed fairly. Therefore, I strongly encourage the authors to add an Ethical Considerations section covering these details. A full ethical review would not be necessary.

Paper Summary:
This paper addresses the problem of dialogue summarization that summarizes a dialogue between several speakers into a text summarization. Specifically, the paper develops a pseudo-paraphrasing approach to augment the original data so that more training pairs are generated for training. Next, prefix-guided generation is used to train a seq2seq language model. Experiments and human evaluation show that the model proposed generates better summarization for dialogues.

Summary Of Strengths:
The idea is simple but works effectively. Psuedo-paraphrase pairs are generated by simply pairing the dialogue with each sentence of summarization. Experiments on two datasets (i.e., SAMSum and DialSumm) demonstrate the improvement of such data augmentation strategy.
The authors conduct comprehensive experiments including evaluation on different settings and error analysis. It is appreciated to include more details and analysis in the appendix.
Summary Of Weaknesses:
Some sections are not very clear. For example, section 2.2 only mentions prefix tokens are used as a hint to instruct model learning but doesn't give enough explanations of how it works. Giving a few prefix examples may help.
Comments, Suggestions And Typos:
It will be great if the authors can include a short related work section that provides some relation work on data augmentation in dialogue summarization.

Overall Assessment: 3 = Good: This paper makes a reasonable contribution, and might be of interest for some (broad or narrow) sub-communities, possibly with minor revisions.
Confidence: 4 = Quite sure. I tried to check the important points carefully. It's unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed something that should affect my ratings.
Best Paper: No
Best Paper Justification:
NA

Limitations And Societal Impact:
NA

Ethical Concerns:
NA

Needs Ethics Review: No
Reproducibility: 4 = They could mostly reproduce the results, but there may be some variation because of sample variance or minor variations in their interpretation of the protocol or method.
Datasets: 4 = Useful: I would recommend the new datasets to other researchers or developers for their ongoing work.
Software: 4 = Useful: I would recommend the new software to other researchers or developers for their ongoing work.
Author Identity Guess: 1 = I do not have even an educated guess about author identity.

Paper Summary:
In this paper, the author proposed to use a 2nd-phase pre-training with the known prefix for dialogue summarization. This method allows the speaker information to appear in the inputs text. It also helps the performance of SamSum and DialSumm datasets. However, they didn't explain why the prefix generation task works.

Summary Of Strengths:
Good way on formulate different dialogue summarization dataset to a single format
Good performance on SamSum and DialSumm
Summary Of Weaknesses:
Missing explaination of using prefix language generation and why it works
Should also evaluate on other datasets like AMI, ICSI
Comments, Suggestions And Typos:
See weakness

Overall Assessment: 2 = Revisions Needed: This paper has some merit, but also significant flaws, and needs work before it would be of interest to the community.
