\section{Conclusion}
Semantic distribution correlation can capture the fine-grained 
information difference between source document and summary. 
The compression ratio represents an important facet of text summarization
problem.
We experimentally showed that SDC/SDC* achieves strong correlations 
with human evaluation scores on summarization tasks.
