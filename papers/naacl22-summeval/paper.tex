\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A document can be summarized in a number of ways.
Reference-based evaluation of summarization has been
criticized for its inflexibility. 
In this paper, we propose a new automatic reference-free 
evaluation metric that compares semantic distribution between 
source document and summary by pretrained language models 
and considers summary compression ratio.
The experiments show that this metric is more consistent 
with human evaluation in terms of coherence, consistency, 
relevance, fluency.
