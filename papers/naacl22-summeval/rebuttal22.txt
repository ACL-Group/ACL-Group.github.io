Thanks for reading our responses.
'add experiments on DUC 03-07..': TAC 2011, DUC 03-07 and TAC 08-10 are from the same organization and 
similar to each other. But TAC 2011 is newer and supercedes the others.

'significant test': The correlation between human and each automatic metric is a numeric value, 
not a statistical distribution, therefore significant test can't be computed. 

'additional eval metrics': GeSERA (2021) indicated these metrics are worse than ROUGE.

'no software released': We did submit the software to ARR.

'third example in Table 2' by HFSU: The red part in third example is actually wrong. The source document in Fig. 1 indicated that delivery of the food, not the restaurants themselves, will be available in 67 cities.

All other revisions can be easily addressed.
