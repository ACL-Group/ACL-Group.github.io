1. refactor code, add docs and comments -- urgent, at least 1 week
2. memory tuning: avoid small temp. objects, GC tuning. this should be easy, 1 or 2 days
3. add future directions to the paper, fix bugs in the paper
4. debug DCMLDA
5. add if-statement (to support TSM)

Future work:
1. add more exponential-family distributions
2. allow the ``topic'' variables in mixtures to be dependent
3. add Gibbs sampling (this may need partition-local storage in GraphX, or we can implement without GraphX)
4. more optimizations (e.g. using word-count for repeated categorical distribution)
5. add Metropolis-Hastings sampler w/ automatically generated proposal distribution or user supplied proposal
6. add general variational inference (5, 6 deal with non-exponential family/ non-conjugate models, but need additional user input)
