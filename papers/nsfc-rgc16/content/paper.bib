  abstract = {Formal languages for probabilistic modeling enable re-use, modularity, and descriptive clarity, and can foster generic inference techniques. We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes. Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.}

A simple, intuitive derivation of this method is given along with guidance on implementation. Also discussed are two applications of the algorithm, one for implementing acceptance-rejection sampling when a blanketing function is not available and the other for implementing the algorithm with block-at-a-time scans. In the latter situation, many different algorithms, including the Gibbs sampler, are shown to be special cases of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Doyle2009,
abstract = {Many different topic models have been used successfully for a variety of applications. However, even state-of-the-art topic models suffer from the important flaw that they do not capture the tendency of words to appear in bursts; it is a fundamental property of lan- guage that if a word is used once in a doc- ument, it is more likely to be used again. We introduce a topic model that uses Dirich- let compound multinomial (DCM) distribu- tions to model this burstiness phenomenon. On both text and non-text datasets, the new model achieves better held-out likeli- hood than standard latent Dirichlet alloca- tion (LDA). It is straightforward to incorpo- rate the DCM extension into topic models that are more complex than LDA.},

abstract = {In this paper, we define the problem of topic-sentiment analysis on Weblogs and propose a novel probabilistic model to capture the mixture of topics and sentiments simultaneously. The proposed Topic-Sentiment Mixture (TSM) model can reveal the latent topical facets in a Weblog collection, the subtopics in the results of an ad hoc query, and their associated sentiments. It could also provide general sentiment models that are applicable to any ad hoc topics. With a specifically designed HMM structure, the sentiment models and topic models estimated with TSM can be utilized to extract topic life cycles and sentiment dynamics. Empirical experiments on different Weblog datasets show that this approach is effective for modeling the topic facets and sentiments and extracting their dynamics from Weblog collections. The TSM model is quite general; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and sentiments, thus has many potential applications, such as search result summarization, opinion tracking, and user behavior prediction.},

@article{Titov2008a,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel framework for extracting the ratable aspects of objects from online user reviews. Extracting such aspects is an important challenge in automatically mining product opinions from the web and in generating opinion-based summaries of user reviews. Our models are based on extensions to standard topic modeling methods such as LDA and PLSA to induce multi-grain topics. We argue that multi-grain models are more appropriate for our task since standard models tend to produce topics that correspond to global properties of objects (e.g., the brand of a product type) rather than the aspects of an object that tend to be rated by a user. The models we present not only extract ratable aspects, but also cluster them into coherent topics, e.g., `waitress' and `bartender' are part of the same topic `staff' for restaurants. This differentiates it from much of the previous work which extracts aspects through term frequency analysis with minimal clustering. We evaluate the multi-grain models both qualitatively and quantitatively to show that they improve significantly upon standard topic models.},

@article{McCallum2009,
abstract = {Discriminatively trained undirected graphical models have had wide empirical success, and there has been increasing interest in toolkits that ease their applica- tion to complex relational data. The power in relational models is in their repeated structure and tied parameters; at issue is how to define these structures in a pow- erful and flexible way. Rather than using a declarative language, such as SQL or first-order logic, we advocate using an imperative language to express various aspects of model structure, inference, and learning. By combining the traditional, declarative, statistical semantics of factor graphs with imperative definitions of their construction and operation, we allow the user to mix declarative and proce- dural domain knowledge, and also gain significant efficiencies. We have imple- mented such imperatively defined factor graphs in a system we call FACTORIE, a software library for an object-oriented, strongly-typed, functional language. In experimental comparisons to Markov Logic Networks on joint segmentation and coreference, we find our approach to be 3-15 times faster while reducing error by 20-25\%—achieving a new state of the art.},
