Datasets that are over 2GB:

dalpiv.dat:
Yellow page extended web server log, similar to the apache logs, but with 4
additional fields: the url that leads to this current transaction, the remote
client info, a two-letter code and an integer code. 

liberty:
Super computer event log from sandia NL.
Each line contains one message, plus four fields which we have added
to facilitate parsing.  Each line is formatted as 
 Cat Utime YYYY.MM.DD Source Message 
where Cat indicates the alert category ("-"indicates no alert), Utime
and date are self-explanatory, Source is the name of the device which
generated the message, and Message is the full message in its
original form.  Messages which were corrupted such that these first
four fields could not be determined are not present in these files.

redstorm:
Super computer log from sandia NL. Similar to liberty but te message part
is bar-separated.
format: dash int date username date time id(path) msg

free_impressions.dat:
impression data of yellow pages for free users. 12 bar-separated fields,
with some empty lines


Datasets that are smaller:

free_clickthroughs.dat:
Yellow page click through streams for free users. Consists of 8 bar separated
fields. 

searchevents.dat:
yellow page search event log

thirdpartycontent.log:
Thir party content streams from yellow page web server. Bar separated records, with many interesting URLs.

strace_jaccn.dat: 
Here are files containing trace data for some of the NERSC applications. These traces are generated by invoking the "strace" utility on every task and piping the data for each task to a separate file. Process ID is used to create unique file names. All applications where run on Jacquard. 
PMEMD 16 tasks, small dataset run  
MADbench 64 tasks, medium dataset run  
MILC 16 tasks, medium dataset run  
The interesting about this data format is that it contains many C-like functions but with very complex arguments (sometimes nested 
definitions like record of lists of records).

LA-UR-06-1446-MX16-NODE-NOZ.TXT:
LANL 256-node HPC cluster super disk replacement data.
HPC2 is a record of disk replacements observed on the compute nodes of a 256 node HPC cluster at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). Each node is a 4-way SMP with 16 GB of memory and contains two 36GB 10K rpm SCSI drives, except for eight of the nodes, which contain eight 36GB 10K rpm SCSI drives each. The applications running on this system are typically large-scale scientific simulations or visualization applications. For each disk replacement, the data set records the number of the affected node, the start time of the problem, and the slot number of the replaced drive. 

The file is a text file space delimited. *** THIS FILE CONTAINS DEPENDENT ARRAY *** But it gives seg faults...
Node numbers in this file start with one (1).  If you are correlating this usage data with failure data
make sure you use the correct node number. The failure data has node numbers as they exist in this data and
node numbers starting with zero.

job submit time (unix time stamp (seconds) time user submitted job to queue)
job suggested start time time (unix time stamp (seconds) time user requested the job to run) 
job deadline time (unix time stamp (seconds) the deadline time for the job) 
job dispatch time (unix time stamp (seconds) the time the job got dispatched to run from the queue) 
number of cpu seconds consumed in user time  (this data may not be completely reliable) for all procs
number of cpu seconds consumed in system time (this data may not be completely reliable) for all procs
total time  (addition of user and system time)
number of process_number node_number pairs to follow
pairs of number job_process_number node_number    (so on the first record above process 0 and process 1 are on node 03)
                                                  (the 4 processor job was run on node 03)
                                                  (on the second record the short hand * 11 means all procs on node 11)


LA-UR-06-0803-MX20_NODES_0_TO_255_EVENTS.csv:
LANL 256-node HPC cluster super computer disk replacement data.
HPC2 is a record of disk replacements observed on the compute nodes of a 256 node HPC cluster at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL). Each node is a 4-way SMP with 16 GB of memory and contains two 36GB 10K rpm SCSI drives, except for eight of the nodes, which contain eight 36GB 10K rpm SCSI drives each. The applications running on this system are typically large-scale scientific simulations or visualization applications. For each disk replacement, the data set records the number of the affected node, the start time of the problem, and the slot number of the replaced drive. 
The file is a csv/text file comma delimited.

This data is only the first 256 nodes 0-255 of Machine 20.

Node numbers in this file start with zero (0).  If you are correlating this usage data with failure data
make sure you use the correct node number. The failure data has node numbers for both starting at zero and starting at 1.
