\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
Ad hoc data sources
are extremely difficult to manage because of their large size,
evolving format, and lack of documentation.
In this paper, we have presented the design, implementation and
evaluation of a system for incrementally learning the structure of 
large or stream ad hoc data files. The output of the
system is a data description in \pads{} language which can further
generate end-to-end data processing tools. 
The system allows the users to get into the iterative learning process
and make the description more accurate and readable.

%The system not only
%produces documentation for the files in the form of a \pads{}
%description, but it can also be used to generate end-to-end
%data processing tools such as a statistical analysis or an
%XML translator.  
%We have shown that the system
%can scale to the point where it can process and learn the
%structure of logs on the order of up to 30GB or more in 
%a few hours.
