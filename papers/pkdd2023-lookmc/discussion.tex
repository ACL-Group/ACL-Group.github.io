\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:discussion}
In the era of large-scale language models, such as GPT-4~\cite{openai2023gpt4}, 
our work on addressing short circuits and enhancing 
data augmentation techniques is significant for 
improving the development and assessment of these models. 
By focusing on robustness, generalization, and interpretability, 
we contribute to more reliable and versatile systems 
that can handle a wide range of language reasoning tasks. 
Our work serves as a stepping stone for continued progress in the field, 
ensuring that models can effectively cope with diverse language challenges.

Future research directions include exploring alternative 
data augmentation techniques, incorporating explainability and 
interpretability methods, and developing new evaluation metrics and benchmarks. 
%Investigating model-agnostic data augmentation 
%approaches could also extend the applicability 
%of our findings to other language tasks and models, 
%further fostering improvements in natural language processing and advancing the robustness, generalization, and interpretability of large-scale language models in various natural language reasoning tasks 
for large-scale language models.
