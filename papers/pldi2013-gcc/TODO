From review:

- Contrary to your wording in the abstract (distributed agents), your
  system is not distributed, as it seems to rely heavily on the
  availability of quick communication (in fact, unix-style 'forking'
  of processes is unlikely to be available in distributed systems in
  the near future) and does not deal with failures. Perhaps it would
  be appropriate to not claim anything about dealing with
  distribution?

- Example programs small
- Resulting programming model unclear

some of the proof sketches are unreadable due to their
use of unexplained (free) variables. 

Section 4 would do well by trying to say something about baseline
programs which do not use speculative non-determinism. This will
be an unfair comparison on many accounts, but right now it is hard
to determine e.g., the level of overhead due to non-determinism.

From response:

cu is used where the agent wants to explicitly gives up the current choice branch.
