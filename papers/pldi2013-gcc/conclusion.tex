\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Speculation and nondeterminism are not new to computing.
In this work, we present a novel framework that joins the two
concepts together in a programmable concurrency control model. 
This framework allows users to specify exclusive choices in their program
and models the combinatorial choices by multiple programs in 
multiple virtual worlds. The advantage of this is that by attempt all
this possibilities, users have much better chance of achieving their
goals and the system can produce better throughput with less 
deadlocks and starvation. We have showed that the theoretical
exponentiality in the combinatorial computation can be effectively
controlled by a commit operator and the program termination and return
can be accelerated using an exit mechanism.
