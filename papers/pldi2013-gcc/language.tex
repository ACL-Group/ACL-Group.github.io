\section{Language for Speculation}\label{sec:language}

In this section, we define a language for speculation -- its syntax and
operational semantics. We also present illustrative examples.
% We start out by presenting the data model which is independent of the rest of the language.
% Then we describe the syntax and the operational semantics of the language,
% and finally we discuss the exit and commit semantics along with some examples
% to help understanding of the language.

\subsection{Examples}\label{sec:examples}

Next we describe some examples to help understanding the language.
