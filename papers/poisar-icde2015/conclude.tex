\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
We present a novel generative model that considers aspect,
sentiment and region. Motivated by user's opinions in
POI reviews, we propose a way to make use of the opinions
to enhance user preference modeling. Our model combines
opinion mining and geographical modeling which has not been
considered in the existing works. Both of the two
aspects are considered to be important, and we show the
effectiveness of the unified model by experiments on
several applications, such as POI recommendation and
user recommendation. We propose an online algorithm
and show it is efficient in top-N recommendation using our model. 
We also explore the satisfaction of 
aspects in regions.
%In the future, we will consider the LDA
%version of the model which may make the extraction of aspects
%more precise. Also, it is challenging if we can incorporate
%time factor and user social network.
