\section{Conclusion}

To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first piece of work that focuses on 
extractive summarization for E-commerce product title.
We proposed a deep and wide model, combining attentional RNN
framework with rich semantic features such as TF-IDF scores and NER tags.
Our model outperforms several popular summarization models,
and achieves ROUGE-1 F1 score of 0.725.
Besides, the result of online A/B testing shows substantial benefits
of our model in real online shopping scenario.
Possible future work include handling similar terms
that appear in the short titles generated by our model.
