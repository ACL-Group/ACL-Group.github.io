\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper studies the problem of automatically extracting a short 
title from a manually written longer description of E-commerce products
for display on mobile devices. 
It is a new extractive summarization problem on short text inputs,
for which we  propose a feature-enriched network model, combining three 
different categories of features in parallel. 
Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms 
several baselines by a substantial gain of 4.5\%.
Moreover, we produce an extractive summarization dataset for E-commerce 
short texts and will release it to the research community.
