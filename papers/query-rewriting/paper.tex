% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Improving the user experience in using search engine, 
we consider the task of concept-based query suggestion, 
in which the user query contains one or more abstract 
concepts. For instance, a word ``movies'' in user query may 
be considered as a concept which can be instantiated into 
``indiana jones'' or ``star wars''. We present a query 
suggestion approach that provides the user with more 
specific queries taken from query log, with each query 
contains instantiation of concepts found in user query. 
We utilize Probase, a taxonomic knowledge base, to find 
the appropriate instantiation. A number of similarity 
scores that include edit distance, word distance, and 
typicality distance are used to measure the relevancy 
of replacement queries. Quality of the queries are also 
considered, using the frequencies and the number of 
click-throughs performed for those queries. The resulting 
queries are then showed to user to improve the search 
experience and helping them to form a better and specific 
query. \textit{Our evaluation shows that the resulting 
queries have high/acceptable relevancy to the user query 
and may represent user intention when searching for certain 
vague concepts.}
