\section{Conclusion}
Session-based recommendation is indispensable when users' historical records are hard to obtain. This paper presents a context-aware sequential architecture for news recommendation that incorporates intra- and inter-session temporal information into representing session sequences. The proposed method not only model the short-term intention of temporary account based on limited interactions, but also deal with the item-cold-start problem. Comprehensive experiments confirm that the proposed algorithm can consistently outperform other state-of-art methods. With respect to future works, our plan is to further investigate how to combine long-term preferences and current interests of sessions to better predict users' next actions.
