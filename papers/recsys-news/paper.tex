\begin{abstract}
News articles are generated every day in online news platforms, and meanwhile many users are using their temporary account without login or within a short session. This set challenges for the existing news recommendation system to extract short term intentions of the user with limited feedback information as well as to recommend newly added articles. Some promising results have been recently achieved by formulating news stream sequentially, and the usage of Deep Learning techniques such as RNN and multi-head attention transformer highlights their effectiveness in extracting sequential information. However, seldom of them deal with the article-cold-start problem and nor do they take into account temporal information in different dimension. In this paper we design time and context-aware session-based news recommendation methods that consider both the temporal information and the context of user interactions. The temporal information contains the inter-session and intra-session information, trying to capture the different life cycles of articles and the information of neighboring sessions. Empirical evaluation on three real-world news datasets shows that our methods alleviate item-cold-start problem, and outperform recently proposed state-of-the-art sequential recommendation approaches.
