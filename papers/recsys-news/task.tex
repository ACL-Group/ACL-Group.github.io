\section{Task Definition}
We formulate our recommendation problem as the sequential recommendation or next item prediction. Assume that each user $u$ has a corresponding interaction sequence $S_u$, which can be represented as \[S_u=\{(x_1,c_1,T_1),(x_2,c_2,T_2),...,(x_T,c_T,T_T)\},\] where $x_j$ denotes the $j$-th news articles that user $u$ interacts with, and $c_j$ denotes the context embedding vectors of the corresponding articles, and $T_j$ denotes the intra-session temporal information of the corresponding interactions. Noted that each user $u$ only appear once, $S_u$ is corresponding to different sessions. Each $S_u$ starts at time $T_u$.

The intra-session temporal information $T_j$ contains two part. One is the time of $j$-th interaction $Tc_j$, which means the time user $u$ \textit{clicks} the $j$-th article and reflects it's position in $S_u$. The other is the \textit{publish} time of $j$-th article $Tp_j$, reflecting the refreshness of it. The $T_u$ reflects the inter-session temporal information because sessions with close start time are more related to each other.

Given a target user $u$ with her sequential of interactive behaviors over items $S_u$, our personalized next-item recommendation task is to predict $x_{T+1}$ that the target user $u$ is most likely to access in his/her next visit. Noted that the long term history of user $u$ is invisible, and we're supposed to predict $x_{T+1}$ in real-time right away after sequential of interactive behaviors from $x_1$ to $x_T$. The whole procedure is depicted in \figref{fig:representation}.
