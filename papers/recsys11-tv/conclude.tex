\section{Conclusion}

The key contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item we develop a framework in which the system captures
user's viewing behaviors and makes real-time recommendations to the users
based on the semantic attributes of the programs they have viewed in the past;
\item we propose algorithms to automatically extract synopsis and other key
attribute values of TV programs from the Web;
\item we propose a user preference model based on the attributes of the
programs watched and watch durations and use this model to make
recommendations;
\item we implemented the end-to-end system, and
evaluated the system's performance and the quality of recommendation by
comparing with four recommendation strategies.
\end{itemize}

In the future work, we will apply our proposed measurements to evaluate PredicTV system.
