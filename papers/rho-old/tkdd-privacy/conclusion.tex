\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we proposed a partial suppression framework for
$\rho$-uncertainty privacy protection.  Previous approaches such as
global suppression generally delete more items to satisfy the same
privacy model.  We also developed two heuristics which produce anonymized
data that is highly useful to data analytics applications.
We compared the two heuristics with state-of-the-art anonymization techniques
in different aspects such as information loss, data distribution preservation,
and useful rule preservation, and the experiments showed that
\begin{itemize}
\item the first heuristic can effectively limit suprious rules while
maximally preserving the useful rules mineable from the original data, and
\item the second heuristic which minimizes the K-L divergence between the
anonymized data and the original data helps preserve the data distribution,
which is a feature largely ignored by the privacy community in the past.
\end{itemize}
We also studied empirically the effects of partial suppression parameters
on the quality of solution (in terms of information loss) and time performance.
This can be used as a general guidance of how to apply the presented framework
to other kinds of data sets that are not covered in the experiments.
Finally the divide-and-conquer strategy that we proposed in section \ref{algo:impmentation}
effectively controls the execution time with limited compromise in the solution quality.
