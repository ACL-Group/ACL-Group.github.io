Dear TKDD Editor,

The attached paper entitled "A Partial Suppression Framework for 
œÅ-uncertainty Privacy Protection" is the first submission to TKDD . It is 
an extended version of the Best Paper Award winning paper published at
DASFAA 2014, which is titled "Rho-uncertainty Anonymization by Partial
Suppression". In this extended version, we have included detailed algorithms
and proofs of several interesting properties, as well as substantially
more experimental results and discussion of related work. 
For any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
We are looking forward to a speedy response.

Best regards,

Kenny Zhu
