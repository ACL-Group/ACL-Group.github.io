Accurately computing semantic similarity between terms is 
a challenging task in the applications of text analytics and 
text understanding.  In this paper, we
presented a lightweight, effective approach for semantic similarity 
between terms with any multi-word expression. 
Our approach first utilizes the isA relationships extracted 
from the Web data as the semantic contexts of the terms. 
Second, it installs clustering on the collected contexts 
to find potential senses of the terms, and then it compares 
the cluster-based contexts to get the semantic similarity between terms. 
When compared to the state-of-the-art semantic similarity computation
methods and the basic algorithm, 
our clustering-based approach has a higher pearson 
correlation coefficient on benchmark data sets with word pairs 
and MWE pairs. Meanwhile, it is more applicable to the 
large scale data sets due to its lower time cost in the 
calculation of semantic similarity between terms.
