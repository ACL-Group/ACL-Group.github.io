\section{Introduction}
if two queries share a set of same clicked URLs, they will convey
similar search intent~\cite{baeza-yates_query_2005,
  beeferman_agglomerative_2000-1}. The “wisdom of the crowds” property
thus makes clickthrough, especially the query co-clicks, a more
precise resource for identifying similar search intent of
queries. However, query co-click information is relative sparse
(i.e. lower recall) in describing search intents compared with the
search result snippets, since usually there are limited clicks for
each query.
