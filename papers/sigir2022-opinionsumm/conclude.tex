\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this work,
we proposed a new data creation method to generate
a semi-structured synthetic training dataset for 
opinion summarization,
which is known for lacking training data.
We also designed an aspect-guided model with opinion-aspect pair encoder and implicit sentence encoder for semi-structured data.
The results showed that
the proposed model can make full use of semi-structured data
and generate high-quality summaries.
As the semi-structured approach is more effective on reviews with explicit opinion information, in the future,
we will enhance our approach to better handle various review summarization.
