R1:
1. motivation of opinion summarizaiton
2. remove first-person, why?
	experiments: with first-person/without first-person
	experiments: few aspect/more aspects ..... sample a summary/each review can become a summary/construct input for summary (Sec. 2.1.1)
3. 2.1.2 -> 2.1.1 extract OAs
4. wording: matched OAs, pseudo matched OAs?
5. N_r, for simplicity, according to the constraints of inference.
   N_r can be a normal distribution. My approach is not depended on that N_r is a constant. 
   Explain N_r is not a constant, it satisfies a distribution.
6. define mixed data/mixed-structured in the introduction
7. title: from mixture of structured and non-structured data
8. 3.5.1, In real-word...
9. 3.5.2, ratio between OAs and stopwords.

R2:
Table 4: remind ablation study.
Table 9: explain

R3:
1.Add human evaluation scores. from 1-5
  Explain Best-worst scaling
2.not high-quality summary -> better summary
3.MA/MM -> matched/mismatched
4.length distribution is related to N_r
5.Results: add discussion of N_r
6.ROUGE
7.explain the dataset
8.Add good examples and bad examples
