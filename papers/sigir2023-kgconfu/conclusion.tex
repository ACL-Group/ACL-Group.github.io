\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we explore an effective method to inject KG knowledge into PSR models called ConFu. With Confu, relationship knowledge in KG can be better fused into PSR model. Our proposed ConFu method can perform well on PSR task and we are looking forward to see that ConFu can be successfully transferred to other domains or tasks in the future, which is also what we plan to do next. Besides, in order to collect better solutions to this task, we release a PSR dataset called MMMPS in life-service scenario with specialized knowledge from KG.

% It is worth mentioning that this ConFu method can not only be applied in e-commerce scenario but all other related tasks with KGs, such as QA task with KG
