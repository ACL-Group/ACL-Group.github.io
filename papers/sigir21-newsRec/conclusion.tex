\section{Conclusion}

Session-based recommendation is indispensable when users' historical records are hard to obtain. By leveraging the positive/negative implicit feedback from users and other rich content \& temporal information, our proposed method not only mitigates the trade-off problem between accuracy and diversity, but also deals with the user/article cold-start problem. This work emphasizes the importance of content information to handle cold-start problem and remind us that if you want to recommend better, you should pay more attention to collect users' positive/negative feedback. In the future, we plan to further investigate how to combine long-term preferences (with the user's  account) and current interests of sessions to better predict users' next actions.
