\section{Related Work}
In this section, we discuss works in the area of news recommendation, session-based
recommendation which targets not only news but other sequential applications, and
finally recommendation systems that exploit temporal information.

\subsection{News Recommendation}
Many news recommendation systems~\cite{wu_neural_2019-1,wu2019npa} are based on the long history of the user, and some of them also use the knowledge graph of entities in the news title as affiliated information~\cite{wang2018dkn, wang_ripplenet:_2018}. Most of them rely on Click Through Rate (CTR), regarding click event as positive explicit feedback, which achieves good performance on long term interests profile of user but works unfavourably on limited user reading history, and sparse history also sets challenges for models to recommend various news to users. Other works consider leveraging implicit feedback. One uses the information of how frequent user returns to help improve recommendation~\cite{zheng2018drn}, another work jointly models click/unclick/dislike as explicit/implicit feedback~\cite{xie2020deep}, and others excavate the quality of news articles~\cite{lu_quality_2019} or the backtracking behavior as the user feedback~\cite{smadja_understanding_2019}. 

However, all above works formulate the recommendation task as conventional recommendation tasks, and recommend articles for users based on their collaborative click history~\cite{zhu2019dan}. They use a well-designed deep neural network to combine the power of factorization machines, such as Wide\& Deep~\cite{cheng2016wide} and deepFM~\cite{guodeepfm2017}, where the relation of items and users are well exploited. Unfortunately, in real-time scenarios, new articles and anonymous users emerge, causing severe cold-start problem. Then if we want to capture users' preference within session and recommend articles with their several interactions as input, this kind of approach with the static user-item matrix is not suitable. Some propose incremental matrix factorization algorithm based on classic MF algorithm by adding a new user or a new article to the matrices with a random initialization~\cite{al2018adaptive}, and others apply meta-learning which aims to train a model that can rapidly adapt to a new task with a few examples~\cite{lee_melu:_2019}, but do not solve the cold-start problem fundamentally.
\subsection{Session-based Recommendation}
Many online recommender systems are proposed to deal with the session-based scenarios~\cite{epure_recommending_2017,zhou_variational_2019}, where the user interaction information is limited and items are increasingly generated. Some traditional content-based or hybrid recommendation approaches are transferred to the session-based recommendation~\cite{sottocornola2018session}.  They combine session-based CF similarity and content-based similarity to recommend top-K similar articles. Some combine a variant of MF adapted to the incremental nature of data streams and a topic drift modeling module~\cite{al2018adaptive}. As for deep learning methods, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) possess properties that make them attractive for sequence modeling of user sessions~\cite{guo_streaming_2019,hidasi2015session,wang2019modeling,moreira_news_2018,wu2019session}. Further, a hybrid encoder with an attention mechanism is introduced to model the sequential behavior of users~\cite{li2017neural,liu2018stamp,xu2019time,song_islf_2019,zhang_feature-level_2019}. 
Besides, many sequential recommendation systems~\cite{pereira2019online,xu2019graph} on music listening, e-commerce purchasing and games playing construct assorted RNN-related architectures (e.g, Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN)~\cite{xu_recurrent_2019}, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)~\cite{hidasi2018recurrent}, Hierarchical Gating Network (HGN)~\cite{xiao2019hierarchical,ma2019hierarchical}), showing RNN's high capacity to modeling user shift preference. On the other hand, some reproduce the result of these recent algorithmic proposals, showing that many of them do not consistently outperform a well-tuned non-neural linear ranking method~\cite{dacrema_are_2019,ludewig_performance_2019}.

Although sequential modeling naturally takes the preference shifting into account, the implicit user feedback and content\&temporal information are neglected. When sampling negative articles, an adaptive negative sampling method based on Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) is proposed~\cite{wang_neural_2018}. Beyond that, few works pay attention to the implicit meaning of negative samples. Randomly sampling from such continuously increasing and high-volume news articles might be fast but won't be effective enough.

\subsection{The Use of Temporal Information}
Sequence and Time Aware Neighborhood (STAN)~\cite{garg2019sequence} takes vanilla SKNN as its special case. They build static time decay functions for three factors: the position of an item in the current session, recency of a past session w.r.t. to the current session, and position of a recommendable item in a neighboring session. This approach can be regarded as rule-based SKNN, with exponential decay function, and the experiment result on e-commerce website even outperforms some deep-learning based approaches. In the deep learning model, some works design different temporal kernel functions for different consumption scenarios~\cite{wang2020make, wu2020deja}. However, the decay function of news articles is fixed, which may undermine the ability to model user's short-term preference towards different articles.
A time-interval-based GRU is proposed to model user session-level representations~\cite{lei_tissa_2019}, and some work~\cite{rakkappan2019context,xu2019time,wu_recommender_2019} treat the time feature of interactions as a temporal context, while they fail to consider the publish/click/active time in the different dimension.
