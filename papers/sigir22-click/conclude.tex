\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we study click popularity prediction of hyperlinks. For this task, we propose five visual features which could be obtained without rendering. We evaluate the effectiveness of the visual features through experiments. The experimental results suggest that the visual features can improve the performance. We further conduct ablation tests to evaluate the effect of our proposed visual features. As a result, we find that every visual feature we have proposed is effective and that \emph{section position} and \emph{within table} are relatively more important.
