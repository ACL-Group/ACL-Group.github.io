\begin{abstract}
As an omnipresent feature on the Web, hypertext links are crucial means for users to retrieve information. However, the sub-optimal organization of website structure may degrade the flow of information. Having a better understanding of the effect of various factors on click popularity can be instructive for the amelioration of website structure. In this paper, we study click popularity prediction on hypertext links. We formulate the problem as the ranking of links according to Click Through Rate (CTR) and utilize Learning to Rank (L2R) algorithms to solve it. We observe the significant impact of visual factors on the CTR of hyperlinks and thus introduce new visual features for the L2R model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed visual features, we conduct experiments on the Wikipedia clickstream dataset. Results have shown that adding visual features can significantly improve the ranking performance across ten different categories. We further conduct ablation tests to quantitively compare the impact of each visual feature.
