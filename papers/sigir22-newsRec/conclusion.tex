\section{Conclusion}
Session-based recommendations are indispensable under the streaming like 
or real-time scenario when users' historical records are unavailable. 
By leveraging the positive and negative implicit feedback from users, as well
as properly modeling the times in the problem, 
our proposed method is simple but effective to improve the 
trade-off between accuracy, diversity and surendipity, 
as shown in experimental results. For further investigation, our positive/negative modules can be plugged into other sophisticated 
session-based recommendation approaches; the automatic diversity metric may not always accord with the user experience, and attention can be paid towards the real user satisfaction; the temporal encoder can encode the physical meaning of the date-time, so maybe the pre-trained temporal embedding can improve the model's understanding of tasks which contain temporal information.
