\begin{abstract}
  News recommendation for anonymous readers is a useful but challenging task for many news portals, where interactions between readers and articles 
  are limited within a temporary login session. 
  Previous works tend to formulate session-based recommendation as 
  a next item prediction task, while they neglect the implicit feedback from 
  user behaviors, which indicates what users really like or dislike. 
  Hence, we propose a comprehensive framework to model user behaviors
  %user's reading behavior through the special encoding of
  %various temporal information, but also user preferences from their 
  through positive feedback (i.e., the articles they spend more time on) and
  negative feedback (i.e., the articles they choose to skip without clicking in).
  Moreover, the framework implicitly models the user using their session start time, and the article using its initial publishing time, in what we call ``neutral
  feedback''.
  Empirical evaluation on three real-world news datasets shows 
  the framework's promising performance of more accurate, diverse and even 
  unexpectedness recommendations than other state-of-the-art 
  session-based recommendation approaches.
