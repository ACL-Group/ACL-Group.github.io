TITLE: Positive, Negative and Neutral: Modeling Implicit Feedback in Session-based News Recommendation

-------------------------  METAREVIEW  ------------------------
Authors propose a comprehensive framework to model user behaviors through positive feedback and negative feedback. Moreover, the framework implicitly models the user using their session start time, and the article using its initial publishing time, in what we call “neutral feedback”. Empirical evaluation on three real-world news datasets shows that their method alleviates the trade-off between the precision and diversity.


Reviewers identified the strengths of the papers as:
- The paper proposes an interesting and novel method for session-based news recommendation.
- The paper provides a lot of technical results and analysis.
- The results are impressive; The experiments are thorough; different components of the proposed method are evaluated; Diversity metrics are used in evaluation; an important aspect of recommendation that is usually neglected.
- there is a good explanation about the problem at hand and the different difficulties encountered.
- The ablation test gives insights into the strength of different parts of the method.
-  The implementation of the model is made publicly available.

However, at the same time, they identified a number of shortcomings, including:
- Using dwell time and temporal features is not an extremely novel contribution, even if new for the specific problem of news recommendation.
- Some claims require citation, specifically the claim that diversity above ~0.8 is indistinguishable for users.
- The description of the network is not easy to understand
- The choice of methods for comparison is not optimal. Only two models are session based recommenders;
- missing citations of recent session based approaches and their comparison

The authors should take the reviewers’ concerns into account when preparing the final version of the paper if it is accepted.

1. Using dwell time and temporal features is not an extremely novel contribution, even if new for the specific problem of news recommendation.
2. Some claims require citation, specifically the claim that diversity above ~0.8 is indistinguishable for users.
3. The term "feedback" is used throughout the paper for what is essentially features derived from the data. This is somewhat confusing since this is not used for labeling or for learning weight, but as a learned feature, and the term "feedback" has a reserved meaning.
 

Minor: The word "penalty" in sec 3.5 should be "penalize".

See weaknesses & strength sections, the paper was an interesting read but the main issue with it is whether the innovation is important enough.

----------- Detailed comments to authors -----------
This paper proposes a new neural architecture for session-based recommendation in the news domain. The approach focuses on extracting feedback signals from user sessions in order to predict the next article they will interact with in a given ongoing session. The proposed method is compared with some baselines and the effect of each component is evaluated as well. The results demonstrate its effectiveness.


I find this paper interesting and well-motivated. However, I see some room for improvements, as follows:

1- The description of the network is not easy to understand. I couldn’t figure out how exactly each type of feedback is generated from session data. The notation table and the figure are helpful, but the text is not easy to follow. Reorganizing it bottom to top instead of top to bottom might help, as well as more clarifications and even some examples in the feedback modeling components.
 
2- I don’t see any reason for the related work to be at the end of the paper. Moving it to after the introduction will help to better understand where the proposed method stands in the literature.

3- Some related works on session-based news recommendation are missing and need to be cited and discussed:

4- The choice of methods for comparison is not optimal. This is my main concern and the reason I am not able to recommend acceptance of this paper. Out of the eight baselines selected, only two of them are proposed originally for news recommendation, namely CBCF and CPRS. However, it is not clear how CPRS is adapted for session-based recommendation. Out of the remaining baselines, five are session-based neural models that are not designed for the news domain, and only initializing the item embeddings with the article embeddings (as suggested in the paper) would not make up entirely for their inherent disadvantage. The proposed method needs to be positioned in the news recommendation literature via comparison with more state-of-the-art news recommenders. See my suggestions above, as well as references [4,5,32] in the paper. There are many surveys on news recommendation that can help in finding suitable baselines, see for example: Raza, Shaina, and Chen Ding. "News recommender
system: a review of recent progress, challenges, and opportunities." Artificial Intelligence Review (2021): 1-52.
If none of the session-based news recommenders cannot serve as a baseline, this should be clearly discussed and justified in the paper.

----------- Detailed comments to authors -----------
This paper presents a model that incorporates implicit feedback into session-based news story recommendations, for non signed-in users. I do think that the proposed method is interesting, even though there are some issues with the writing and notation. For instance, it is unclear what exactly x_i is or how it is obtained, what a 'preference query' is, and why the cross-entropy-like loss function in Eq. 16 is the best choice. Furthermore, the authors compare their method against numerous baselines on multiple test collections and show significant improvements. While I also appreciate the detailed ablation study and other result analyses, I'm not sure what Figure 5 adds and I would liked to have seen some anecdotal evidence in the form of concrete examples of actual differences in recommendations between the systems instead.
