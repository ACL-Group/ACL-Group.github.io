\section{Task Definition}
\label{sec:task}
%The temporally ordered user interactions lead to the streaming nature of session data. Therefore it's natural and realistic to formulate the news recommendation task as a session-based recommendation task to predict next-item. 
Assume that an anonymous user $u$ produces a sequence of click
events $S_u$ with length $T$, which can be represented as \[S_u: (n_1^u)\rightarrow(n_2^u)\rightarrow...\rightarrow(n_i^u)\rightarrow...,\]
where $n_i^u$ denotes the id of the $i$-th clicked article. 

In the training phase, the recommendation system aims to model the 
user feedback sequence as vector $\mathbf{x_s}$, 
maximizing the similarity between
the vector of predicted next-article ($n_{i+1}^u$) and $\mathbf{x_s}$. 
While in the test phase, 
given interaction sequence $S_u$ as input, 
we produce a ranking list $R$ with the probability that the target user $u$ is likely to click next from high to low. 
Typically a recommender needs to recommend more
than one item for a user, thus the top-k items in $R$ are recommended.
Note that in our anonymous settings, each user $u$ only appears once, 
which means training set and test set do not share the same users. 

\tabref{tb:note} summarizes some critical symbols and notations we use, 
and in later sections, for brevity, we ignore the superscript $u$ 
when discussing the information for a particular user. To explain further, the set $Imp_u$ denotes the articles in the vicinity of the articles
being clicked, which may have left an impression on the user.
