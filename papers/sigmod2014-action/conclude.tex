\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
In this paper, we present a heuristic solution to the
action conceptualization problem which seeks to generalize the
arguments (either object or subject) of a verb into a minimum number
of concepts drawn from a probabilistic taxonomy. These concepts
must cover all the arguments in the input data and must not have
significant overlap with each other. We automatically generated
such action concepts for 200 most frequently used English verbs and
showed that such a lexicon represent finer grained semantics of
verbs, thus can be used in a variety of applications for
understanding text and outperforms several well-known related approaches
or lexicons. One possible future direction is to generate mappings
between action concepts to noun concepts, such as from
``\underline{play}/instrument'' to ``performance'' and from
``country/\underline{invade}'' to ``war.''
