\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eval}

In this section, we conduct four experiments to evaluate our action concept lexicon.
First, we present the datasets and preprocessing. Then, we evaluate the lexicon
by two kinds of metrics, namely accuracy and overlap. Finally, we adopt our
lexicon to three applications: action argument identification, automatic action
frame extraction and concept similarity, to show the effectiveness of using our
lexicon to solve practical problems.
