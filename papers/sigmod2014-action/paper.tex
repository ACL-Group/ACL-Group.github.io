\begin{abstract}
Verbs play a central role in both syntax and semantics of natural
language. This paper studies the problem of abstracting a verb and
its arguments into what we call ``action concepts''. An action concept
represents a particular fine-grained usage and semantics of the verb
under certain context. We define this
problem as a combinatorial optimization problem and present two
heuristic solutions. We applied the algorithms
on large web data and automatically extract a lexicon of action concepts
for 200 most frequently used verbs in English language. Such a lexicon
lies between the coarse-grained FrameNet which provides shallow semantics
and ReVerb which are too specific to recognize verb uses which are never
encountered before. Furthermore, our lexicon is suitable for both
human reading and machine computation. We demonstrate several potential
applications of such action concept lexicon and show that
it enables improved performance
in the tasks of text understanding.
