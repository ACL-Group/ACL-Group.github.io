\subsection{ActionNet}
\label{sec:efficiency}
We build two lexicons w.r.t. Probase and WordNet. We call
these two lexicons as $ActionNet_p$ and $ActionNet_w$, respectively.
We report the number of total concepts, number of concepts/verb,
and the standard deviation ($\sigma$) of number of concepts among different verbs,
in \tabref{tab:anstat}.

\begin{table}[th]
\centering
\scriptsize
\caption{Statistics on ActionNet(PB) and ActionNet(WN)}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline
Lexicon & \# Concepts & \# Concepts/Verb & $\sigma$ \\ \hline \hline
ActionNet(PB)& 41273  & 4.08 & 1.41 \\ \hline
ActionNet(WN)&  88279 & 8.83 & 5.29\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:anstat}
\end{table}

We record the running times of our branch-and-bound algorithm
for the lexicons learned with the
four possible combinations of taxonomies and datasets
on a machine with Intel i7-4770 3.4GHz
CPU and 32GB memory, and report them in \tabref{tab:time}.
We ignore the time for sorting candidate concepts because that
is a preprocessing step whose result can be shared by all verbs.
%\GY{whose result can be reused by the verb for the next times.}
Typically the preprocessing takes just under 1 minute.
The times reported are averaged on 3 independent runs for each verb.
The table shows that our algorithm is
efficient enough to generate the action concept lexicon for most verbs.
The running times on Probase are much longer than those on WordNet,
because the concept space of Probase is much larger than WordNet
(14,262,280 concepts in Probase versus 17,157 synsets in WordNet).
