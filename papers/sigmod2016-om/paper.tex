\begin{abstract}
Making structured summarization of massive user reivews is both useful and challenging. Specifically we want to find out what are the important aspects for some kind of product. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage clustering approach towards finding the best aspect words from user reviews. Our approach takes as input a set of user reviews of a certain kind of product, outputs a set of words that summarizes most important aspects of the product.
