6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
The paper introduces a large-scale e-commerce Cognitive Concept net named “AliCoCo”, which is practiced in Alibaba. The authors formally define user needs in e-commerce, then conceptualize them as “concept” nodes in the net. The authors also present details on how AliCoCo is constructed semi-automatically and its successful, ongoing and potential applications in e-commerce.
7. List 3 or more strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1. The authors propose to bridge the semantic gap between user needs and current ontologies in most e-commerce platforms.
S2. The authors propose a specially designed e-commerce cognitive concept net that is in practice in Alibaba.
S3. The authors present AliCoCo's successful, ongoing and potential applications in e-commerce.
8. List 3 or more weak points, labeled W1, W2, W3, etc.
W1. It will be interesting to see how this concept nets handle heterogeneity in semantics.
W2. The authors mention how 'lack of context' makes the task difficult. I did not understand why context is missing. Context can be inferred.
W3. It would be good to empirically understand if and how AliCoCo is different from Amazon's Product Knowledge Graph.
9. Detailed evaluation. Number the paragraphs (D1, D2, D3, etc.)
The authors mention how 'lack of context' makes the task difficult. I did not understand why context is missing. Context can be inferred from user's query history (if a user is traveling, her recent queries will reflect that), user's demographics (location), user's temporal context, user's main category (if a user has a baby at home, her queries will indicate that),

6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
Queries to shopping engines do not always specify a product or category of products. Instead, queries are functional, they describe what they want the product to do for them. The usual ontologies/schemas of e-commerce engines are not prepared for such queries because they only model the properties of products. This paper builds a functional ontology and maps products into that ontology, thereby being able to answer functional queries.
7. List 3 or more strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1. Important problem that all e-commerce engines have and struggle with

S2. Nice solution (not surprising, but well done)

S3. Good experiments and impact.
8. List 3 or more weak points, labeled W1, W2, W3, etc.
W1. The English is confusing at times

W2. The terminology of the different parts of AliCoCo are a bit confusing. For example, a better name for e-commerce concepts is "functional concepts" (they describe the function that the product is good for.
9. Detailed evaluation. Number the paragraphs (D1, D2, D3, etc.)
D1. Seems like the relation between items and e-commerce products is not a boolean true/false relationship. For example, there might be some probability attached to whether an item satisfies an e-commerce concept, or it may even be subjective. Have you seen the issue come up?

D2. English correction, 4 lines before section 4.3: "Only if the accuracy reaches". Same mistake in the second paragraph of 6.1.

6. Summary of contribution (in a few sentences)
This paper describes the end-to-end design of Alicoco, an e-commerce knowledge graph for Alibaba. Within this system, the paper drills down on the machine learning-based implementation of several technical components: (1) Primitive concept mining (identifying strings like “dress” and labeling them using the pre-defined taxonomy), (2) Hypernym discovery between primitive concepts, (3) Identifying higher-level e-commerce concepts, and (4) Item association (mapping the catalog of items in Alibaba into the Alicoco knowledge graph).
7. List 3 or more strong points, labeled S1, S2, S3, etc.
S1: The paper describes an industrial-scale system end-to-end. I appreciate that building a knowledge graph for e-commerce is an inherently messy task. The paper is open about which parts of this problem are addressed manually (e.g., taxonomy construction) and which sub-problems are addressed automatically using machine learning.

S2: This paper addresses a topic of contemporary interest. I imagine that it will be quite interesting to other SIGMOD attendees from ecommerce companies.

S3: The paper includes a discussion about how each sub-system was evaluated.
8. List 3 or more weak points, labeled W1, W2, W3, etc.
W1: In my opinion, the main contribution of this paper lies not in the design of any particular component, but in the description of the end-to-end system. The ML models uses for each sub-task aren’t strictly novel, from a machine learning point of view.

W2: The English grammar and style could be improved throughout the paper. If this paper is accepted, I would suggest hiring a professional editor prior to submitting the final version.

W3: The evaluation is based entirely on proprietary data. This is perhaps expected for the industry track, but it means that other authors won't be able to compare future work.
9. Detailed evaluation. Number the paragraphs (D1, D2, D3, etc.)
D1: I found the terminology used in this paper to be fairly confusing. Only after reading the whole paper, and then coming back to Section 2, did I understand what the authors meant by “primitive concept,” “e-commerce concept,” and “item.” I think Section 2 could be revised to make these ideas much clearer. I would also consider using the term “catalog item” rather than “item.” (I understood “item” to be something listed for sale on Alibaba.)

D2: (Nitpick) At the end of Section 2, the paper refers to “Figure 1(c),” but I think this should be “Figure 2(c)”

D3: In Section 3.2, I don’t think it is necessary to give the full details of how the BiLSTM-CRF works, since the model itself is not a core contribution of this paper. Figure 4 + references to [14, 23] should be sufficient.

D4: In Section 3.3.3, is the approach the same as classical uncertainty sampling? Please include a reference to past work about uncertainty sampling, and explain how (if) what you are doing is different. If it’s not different (i.e., you are just using classical uncertainty sampling), then simply say that, and omit the extended description.
