\section{Transfer Learning Approach}
Obtaining the above features for link and time,
we first apply several classic machine learning models for regression (Linear Regression, Neural Network model\footnote{A two-layer fully connected network model.}, Support Vector Regression).
They are trained on source areas with above-explored spatiotemporal features and then predict traffic condition on target areas as a test.
Afterwards, we present a novel transfer learning approach named CTMP.
