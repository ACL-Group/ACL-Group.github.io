\section{Transfer Learning Scenario}
%In this section, we define our problem in a mathematically.
Consider we have a set of $n$ road segments with traffic speed sensors. 
At any given time $t$, 
each sensor $i$ provides a traffic speed reading at this current time, denoted as $v_i[t]$.
Traffic speed prediction problem is to predict a future traffic speed like $v_i[t+h]$ at a previous time $t$. 
Most models utilize historical traffic data to predict the future speed of the same areas. 
However, when historical data such as $v_i[1:t]$ is not available, it is infeasible for them to predict. 

In this scenario, a transfer learning~\cite{Pan:Survey} approach is supposed to exploit the data of some \textit{source areas} $\mathcal{S}$ to build a prediction model for other \textit{target} areas $\mathcal{T}$, where there is little traffic speed data.
Mathematically, given $\{v_i[1:t]|i\in \mathcal{S}\}$, a transfer learning model is expected to be able to predict $\{v_j[1:t]|j\in \mathcal{T}\}$.
