\chapter{Background}
\label{chap:background}
This chapter first presents some preliminary knowledge about statistical
inference and, in particular, Bayesian inference using variational message
passing, a popular variational inference algorithm.  It then introduces the
concepts of MapReduce and the in-memory MapReduce framework Apache Spark along
with its built-in graph processing library GraphX. Finally, we address the
implementation concerns of InferSpark on Apache Spark/GraphX stack.
