\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This paper presents InferSpark, 
a declarative Bayesian inference framework on Spark.
InferSpark, to our best knowledge, is the first declarative 
statistical inference framework
that is built on top of a distributed computing platform.
Our empirical evaluation shows that InferSpark can successfully express 
some known Bayesian models in a very succinct manner
and can carry out distributed inference at scale.
InferSpark will open-source.  
The plan is to invite the community to extend InferSpark to 
support other types of Bayesian models 
and to support more inference algorithms (e.g., MCMC).

We have also designed and implemented a new graph processing framework,
InferSpark-Graph to replace GraphX in the CodeGen module of InferSpark.
The performance of InferSpark is greatly improved using
InferSpark-Graph instead of GraphX. InferSpark-Graph is also applicable to
existing applications with few modifications to the source code, allowing them
to enjoy the performance boost brought by the new design.
