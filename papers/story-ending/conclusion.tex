\section{Conclusion}
Predicting story ending is a challenging task in artificial intelligence.
To understand a story, it is sufficient to represent the story by its key
commonsense concepts and events, preserving the informative words.
%discarding other unimportant words. 
It is also important to capture the relations between these concepts and
events across the sentences so that inference can be made following
the story line. 
Our approach well integrated these ideas to achieve the 
current best performance on an unbiased dataset. 
We consider the investigation of
explicit representation of commonsense relations in the story to allow
better interpretability of predication result as future work.
