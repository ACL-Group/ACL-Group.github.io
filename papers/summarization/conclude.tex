\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}


In this paper, we propose an idea that semantic flow plays a very 
important part in the overall readability of documents. So, we produce 
a score that indicates the similarity between the semantic flows 
in the system summary and model summary. We want that the new score can
better reflects the readability of the system summary. 

We use topic-word distributions to represent the sematic flow in a summary. 
We measure the similarity between semantic flows by using time-series-based 
metric such as discrete time warping (DTW) and other ordinal association 
metrics such as Kendall's tau, Spearman's coefficients. 

In order to verify our idea, we use the data provided by AESOP 2011 
and compare our score with the human judgement and other 25 
summarization evaluation system in AESOP 2011. Actually, we have a better
correlation with human judgement on readability. However, how to achieve 
high correlation with human evaluation on pyramid and responsiveness 
at the same time is still an open research topic.
