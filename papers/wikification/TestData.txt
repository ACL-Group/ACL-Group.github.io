One day, people won¡¯t have to type queries into a box to search for information. It¡¯ll be delivered to them, via their various screens, based on where they are, who is nearby and what they might like and need to know. Google gave a glimpse of that future on Wednesday at its developer conference in a feature called Google Now, which will act as a kind of automated personal assistant on Android smartphones. The service, which will roll out as part of the next update to Google¡¯s mobile operating system, will do things like remind an Android owner of a lunch date ¡ª but also who it is with, how to get there and when to leave, based on current traffic congestion. And based on your past Google searches, it will keep you up to date on flight information and sports scores.

A kid from Nebraska shows up in New York City to make it big. This kid was Bryan Odell, a 21-year-old college dropout who lived with his parents. Gangly, with curly blond hair, he looked and talked- as if he arrived straight from central casting. (¡°I was just a kid from Nebraska,¡± he says.) But central casting had nothing to do with it. As an aspiring YouTuber, he cast himself. Odell¡¯s destination was the Manhattan office of Google Inc., YouTube¡¯s corporate parent. He was among the 25 winners of a competition called Next Up, which is aimed at ¡°accelerating the growth of the next big YouTube stars,¡± as an official YouTube blog explained. The prize included four days of tips and training from ¡°YouTube experts¡± in New York. It also included a $35,000 check, no strings attached.

This is the way the world is now. One obscene text can land your kid with harassment charges or underage porn. Unwise posts on Facebook or videos posted that share overmuch will be on the Internet forever. Whenever minors are in a situation where they can ruin their lives by using poor judgment, their parents have a right and obligation to supervise them. Electronic devices are so portable and so powerful these days that there¡¯s no way to supervise without some kind of surveillance software. You¡¯ll thank me for this when you¡¯re older, kid.
