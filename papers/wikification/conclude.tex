\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}
Phrase Sense Disambiguation is an important problem in
natural language processing.
In this paper, we show that it is possible to use Wikipedia
as a reliable and comprehensive source to bootstrap a process that
disambiguates every possible noun phrases that are not yet linked
in Wikipedia articles and then use the co-occurrence
information thus obtained to disambiguate noun phrases in new documents,
a process known as wikification.
Our evaluation showed that the co-occurrence based wikification achieves
very high accuracy (up to 91.42\%) on various kinds of articles
efficiently (over 1000 words per second) by using just 10,000 popular
Wikipedia articles and moderate computation resources.
