* In introduction, define clearly what is our problem, i.e., a k-scene
classification. When we claim that we can do large number of scenes, highlight
that we mean we can choose k scenes from large number of scenes.

* Improve vocabulary collection and scene-event distribution.

* Give more experimental results for vocabulary collection, scene-event
distribution.

* Better, clearer idea in the bootstrapping approach. Is it really effective? Eval results?

* Multiple typos, italicizing of et al., "distribution of event car".

* Discussion and comparisons in related work
