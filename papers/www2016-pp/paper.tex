% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the

% 5 sentences
%1. gap between NL and KB
The task of paraphrasing to translate a natural language relation into structured knowledge.
Due to the incompleteness of a knowledge base (KB), paraphrasing is important for
bridging semantic gaps between NL representations and canonical forms in KB.
%2. presents
We presents a framework to model the semantic representation of a binary relations based on
a small set of relation instances, and to infer a set of relation schemas.
%3. what's the schema look like
Each relation schema is a graph which combines different predicates in KB.
%4. MDL principle
Our framework follows the \textit{minimum description length} principle, which optimizes the
cost of transmitting relation instances and the schemas.
%5. apply to  &  competitive
Comparing with state-of-the-art paraphrasing systems, the experiments show that our system can improve
both schema quality and the F1 score of binary relation instances extracted by schemas over different knowledge bases.
