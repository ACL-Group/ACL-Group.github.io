	\begin{abstract}
		Commonsense knowledge consists of short and simple concepts about the everyday life such as ``blue sky'' instead of ``green sky'', which all humans agree with.
		Incorporating commonsense knowledge to machines is a long-standing challenge to fulfill real artificial intelligence.
		Unlike previous work mainly focusing on inferences between long sentences, we target on short phrase pairs, which is more challenging for a lack of surrounding context. 
		With the help of our constructed \textit{Concept Association Graph} which contains abundant web knowledge, 
		we propose a new dataset \textbf{CoCon} with over 9,000 pairs of short phrases extracted from web queries, which is designed for testing the capability of machines on commonsense reasoning.
%\KZ{I suggest we rename the dataset to CoCon, to avoid confusion with MS Coco and also
%contradiction should be simplified to con rather than co.}
		Preliminary experiments show that large pre-trained language models such as BERT and ERNIE are still lagging behind human performance by a large margin on CoCon, which indicates that further efforts are needed to enable machines to grasp such commonsense knowledge. 
%\KZ{I don't quite see this paper's relevance to the Web! This should be stressed both
%in abstract and in the intro.}
