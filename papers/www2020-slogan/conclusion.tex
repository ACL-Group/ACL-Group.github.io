\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we study an interesting problem on how to 
automatically generate slogans in an e-commerce platform.
We propose a novel method SALE
based on Seq2Seq learning.
SALE introduces item preference 
and combines with topic as input,
then  incorporates \emph{is-a} relations for semantics representations enhancement,
finally integrates a pre-trained language model at inference 
to generate quality slogans.
We create a new dataset for automating slogan generation.
Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our model.
SALE outperforms all competing baselines on both automatic evaluation
and human evaluation.
