\section{Conclusion}
To tackle the problem of missing information in product descriptions on e-commerce websites, we propose the task of Diverse CQGen to request for various unstated aspects in the writing with a group of semantically different questions. We then propose KPCNet to deal with this novel task as well as improve the specificity of the questions with the prior knowledge on user needs in the form of keywords. Human judgements showed that KPCNet is able to generate more specific questions and promote better group-level diversity. Oracle tests with ground truth keywords provided in keyword selection showed strong performance, indicating the great potential to be exploited from improving keyword prediction possibly with external knowledge. Future works may include utilizing richer external knowledge to improve the keyword prediction, and solutions for the occasionally illogical generations. We also believe that our approach can be applied to other scenarios with slight domain-specific modifications on the utilized knowledge.
