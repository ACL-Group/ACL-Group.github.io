\begin{abstract}
  Product descriptions on e-commerce websites often suffer from 
missing important aspects. \textit{Clarification question generation} (CQGen) can be a promising approach to help alleviate the problem. Unlike traditional QGen assuming the existence of answers in the context and generating questions accordingly, CQGen mimics user behaviors of asking for unstated information. The generated CQs can serve as a sanity check or proofreading to help e-commerce 
merchant to identify potential missing information before advertising their
product, and improve consumer experience consequently. 
Due to the variety of possible user backgrounds and use cases, 
the information need can be quite diverse but also specific to a detailed
topic, while previous works assume generating one CQ per context and 
the results tend to be generic. We thus propose the task 
of \textit{Diverse CQGen} and also tackle the challenge of specificity. 
We propose a new model named \textit{KPCNet}, which generates CQs with 
Keyword Prediction and Conditioning, to deal with the tasks. 
Automatic and human evaluation on 2 datasets (\texttt{Home \& Kitchen}, 
\texttt{Office}) showed that KPCNet can generate more specific questions 
and promote better group-level diversity than several competing baselines. \footnote{Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/blmoistawinde/KPCNet}}
