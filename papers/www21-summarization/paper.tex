\begin{abstract}
Abstractive summarization is useful in providing 
a summary or a digest of news or other web texts and 
enhancing users reading experience, especially when they are
reading on small displays such as mobile phones.
However, existing encoder-decoder summarization models 
have difficulty learning the latent \textit{alignment} between 
source documents and summaries because of their
vast disparity in length.
In this paper, we propose a extractor-abstractor framework in which 
the keyword-based extractor selects a few sets of salient sentences 
from the input document and then the abstractor paraphrases 
these sets of sentences in parallel, which are more aligned to 
the summary, to generate the final summary. 
The new extractor and abstractor are pretrained from a set of
``pseudo summaries'' extracted by specially designed heuristics, 
and then further trained
together in a reinforcement learning framework.
The results show that the proposed model generates high-quality summaries 
with faster training speed and less training memory footprint,
and outperforms the state-of-the-art models
on CNN/Daily Mail, Webis-TLDR-17, Webis-Snippet-20, WikiHow and DUC-2002 datasets.
