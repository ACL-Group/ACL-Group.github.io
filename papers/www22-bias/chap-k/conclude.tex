\section{Conclusion}

Our work focus on incorporating different levels of context: neighborhood-level, article-level and event-level in sentence-level informational bias detection. We proposed MultiCTX, a model composed of contrastive learning and relational sentence graph attention network to encode such multi-level context at different stages.

Our model (F1=46.08) significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art model (F1=44.10) by 20 percentage points. Therefore, we conclude that our model successfully learns from contextual information and that multi-level contextual information can effectively improves 
the identification of sentence-level informational bias.
