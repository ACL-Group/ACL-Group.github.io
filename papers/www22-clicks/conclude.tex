\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we study click popularity prediction of hyperlinks. For this task, we propose five visual features which could be computed without rendering. After experimenting with our visual features and other features, we can obtain better results with our visual features. We further conduct ablation tests to evaluate the influence of our proposed visual features. As a result, we find that every visual feature we have proposed is effective and that \emph{section position} is the most effective feature.
