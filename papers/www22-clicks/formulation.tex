\section {Task Formulation}

The set of articles is $P = \{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_n\}$. For each article $p_i$, we use $L_i$ to represent its corresponding set of hypertext links, where $L_i = \{l_1, l_2, \cdots, l_{N_i}\}$ and $N_i = |L_i|$.  For any hyperlink $l$ on page $p$, we define the click counts of this hyperlink as $click(p, l)$. The clickstream data $click(p, l)$ is then used as our ground truth.

Given an article $p_i$ and its associated set of links $L_i$, every link $l_j \in L_i$ has its corresponding label $y_j$ indicating its true ranking. Ranking hypertext links can be viewed as a task of find permutation $\pi = \{y_1, y_2, \cdots, y_{N_i}\}$ on indices $\{1,2,\cdots,N_i\}$. 

Each hyperlink $l_j$ on the pages can be characterized by a feature vector $\vec{x_j}$. The Learning to Rank algorithm then automatically learns a model for hyperlink ranking from all the feature vectors.
