\section{Depression Templates}

Here we provide the templates in detail. We mainly use a combination of 3 direct depression descriptions and the 21 indirect symptoms derived from BDI-II (Table \ref{tab:BDI-II}). We also experimented other well-known depression scales like HDRS (Table \ref{tab:Hamilton}), CES-D (Table \ref{tab:CES-D}) and PHQ-9 (Table \ref{tab:PHQ-9}). The original scales usually contain different descriptions under the same dimension to distinguish different level of intensity or frequency. However, we find that current sentence representations have difficulty in capturing such nuanced differences. We thus condense the descriptions of each dimension into one general template (A few may have more, if there are significant intra-dimension difference).
