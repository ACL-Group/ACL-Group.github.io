\section{Ethical and Broader Impact Statement}

This work aims to help people suffering from depression, but have not yet been diagnosed due to the difficulty in receiving clinical help or the stigmatization of the disease. The proposed method can conduct early and efficient depression detection on social media, which may facilitate its wide deployment on social platforms, and enable the immediate intervention into their diseases to save their lives. The diagnostic basis may also provide explanations to the patients or clinical practitioners to build their trust in the system.
