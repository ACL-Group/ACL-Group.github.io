Rebuttal Draft
#General
Many thanks to the precious comments by all the reviewers!
Regarding the general concern on the relevance of this paper to the Web Conference as well as the work's 
usefulness: our research is a novel example of web data processing and mining, and we show how web data can be used for a serious scientific endeavor. Knowing the acoustic differences between dogs from two cultures may only be the beginning of more in-depth study of animal's language capability which is a big science question. By showing that the study of animal communication can be done on web data, it's a major paradigm and methodology shift for the animal science community. This opens up great opportunities for collaboration between web mining researchers and biology or other scientific research communities. 

Regarding your general concern on the variety and breadth of our dataset: the work and dataset described by this paper is a pilot study that will lead to more animal species and larger quantity and varieties. A quick search on the YouTube, which is only one of the many sources available, can show that there are dozens of animal species, such as canines, felines, and birds, that have significance presence online. The general animal language processing
pipeline can be readily adapted to all these species and create more data.

In summary, our paper not only aligns with the themes and objectives of the Web Conference but also contributes a novel perspective to the field, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research and collaboration. We are confident that our work holds substantial importance for the general audience and the scientific community, heralding new insight in the study of animal communication using web data.

#Reviewer1
Thank you for you time and effort for reviewing this paper. Please refer to the general response. 
While this paper may diverge from the traditional TheWebConf paper approach which emphasizes on novel 
data mining models or algorithms, its goal is to showcase that traditional web mining or the web data itself can be a useful and enabling technology and resources to bridge the data gap in biological science.

#Reviewer2
I want to express my sincere gratitude for your thoughtful and constructive comments. Please refer to the general response for your concern about the scope of our dataset.

The analytical findings of our paper primarily delve into the cultural impact of host speech on dogs. However, it's important to note that the processing framework we developed, along with the extensive data extracted from the web, have broader applications beyond our current study. This framework can be effectively utilized in various other research areas, notably in the semantic analysis of animal communications. The versatility of our approach lies in its potential to unravel complex patterns and meanings within animal communication systems, offering valuable insights into interspecies interactions. This aspect of our research highlights its adaptability and relevance to a wide spectrum of scientific inquiries.


#Reviewer3
Thank you for your insightful feedback. We would love to answer some of your concerns in the comments.

The novelty of the paper is the unique use of web data in a scientific field (animal behavioral science), 
where web data is rarely considered useful. Our paper may induce a paradigm shift for researchers in this field 
that moves from more costly data collection approaches to the proposed web-based method.

#Reviewer4
Thank you for the thorough review on our paper. We will definitely clarify some of the concepts such as SHAP in the revised paper. Please refer to the general response for your concern on the usefulness of our paper.
