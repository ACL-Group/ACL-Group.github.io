Paper TitleDoes My Dog “Speak” Like Me? The Acoustic Correlation between Pet Dogs and Their Human Owners
Track NameAAAI2024

Reviewer #1
Questions
1. Summary Please briefly summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words. (Please do not include your evaluation of the paper here).
The paper presents a problem of exploring the possible correlation between domestic dog vocal expressions and their human host's language environment. The authors construct a large-scale dataset of Shiba Inu dog vocals from YouTube videos, and compare the acoustic features of dog vocals from English and Japanese language environments. They also analyze the correlation between dog vocals and host speech, and conduct human evaluation on the perceptual differences. The main findings are that dog vocals from different language environments have distinctive differences in frequency and speed, which correlate well with human speech.

2. Strengths and Weaknesses Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, touching on each of the following dimensions: - Novelty (how novel are the concepts, problems addressed, or methods introduced in the paper) - Quality (is the paper technically sound?) - Clarity (is the paper well-organized and clearly written?) - Significance (comment on the likely impact of the paper on the AI research community, i.e., explain how the paper might impact its own sub-field or the general AI community.).
The weaknesses of the paper:
1） The scope of the study is limited to one dog breed (Shiba Inu) and two language environments (English and Japanese). It is unclear whether the findings can be generalized to other dog breeds or other languages. The authors should discuss the limitations and implications of their study, and suggest future directions for expanding the scope.
2）The analysis of the host speech is not very thorough, as the authors only use GeMAPs features to compare English and Japanese speech. It would be interesting to use other features or methods to analyze the linguistic characteristics of these two languages, such as phonetic, prosodic, or syntactic features.
3）The correlation analysis between dog vocals and host speech is based on Pearson's correlation coefficient, which only measures linear relationships. It is possible that there are other types of relationships or interactions between dog vocals and host speech that are not captured by this measure. The authors should consider using other methods to explore the correlation between dog vocals and host speech, such as regression models or causal inference methods.
4）The human evaluation is based on a small sample size (30 participants) and a subjective rating scale (four dimensions). It would be better to use a larger sample size and a more objective measure to evaluate the perceptual differences between dog vocals from different language environments, such as similarity judgments or identification tasks.

3. Questions for the Authors Please carefully list the questions that you would like the authors to answer during the author feedback period. Think of the things where a response from the author may change your opinion, clarify a confusion or address a limitation. Please number your questions.
What is the contribution significant of this work? or what impact will it have?

4. Reproducibility Does the paper provide enough information to be reproducible? If not, please explain (It may help to consult the paper’s reproducibility checklist.)
Yes

5. Resources Are there novel resources (e.g., datasets) the paper contributes? (It might help to consult the paper’s reproducibility checklist)
No

6. Ethical considerations Does the paper adequately address the applicable ethical considerations, e.g., responsible data collection and use (e.g., informed consent, privacy), possible societal harm (e.g., exacerbating injustice or discrimination due to algorithmic bias, etc.)? If not, explain why not. Does it need further specialized ethics review?
Yes

7. OVERALL EVALUATION Please provide your overall evaluation of the paper, carefully weighing the reasons to accept and the reasons to reject the paper.
Reject: For instance, a paper with poor quality, limited impact, poor reproducibility, mostly unaddressed ethical considerations.

8. CONFIDENCE How confident are you in your evaluation?
Quite confident. I tried to check the important points carefully. It is unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed some aspects that could otherwise have impacted my evaluation.

1. Summary Please briefly summarize the main claims/contributions of the paper in your own words. (Please do not include your evaluation of the paper here).
This paper is about finding out of humans and their dogs have acoustic relationships between how they "speak". They found significant differences between dogs whose owners spoke other languages.

2. Strengths and Weaknesses Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, touching on each of the following dimensions: - Novelty (how novel are the concepts, problems addressed, or methods introduced in the paper) - Quality (is the paper technically sound?) - Clarity (is the paper well-organized and clearly written?) - Significance (comment on the likely impact of the paper on the AI research community, i.e., explain how the paper might impact its own sub-field or the general AI community.).
It's cute, but you haven't said why this is an area worth studying. Apart from it being an interesting and underexplored problem, who cares? What does science and society gain from knowledge to a yes or no question like this?

Focus is mostly on the dataset, because without this they suffer from reproducibility issues. Sorry to say it's still not very reproducible despite lots of space spent describing the data. The dataset is also not publicly available nor do the authors say it will be publicly available (privacy concerns??)

3.2 and 3.2 have strange headings that look like the author forgot to change their section headings from a rough draft

Can you re-word sentences like this? It's just awkward to read in English: "How hosts language influence their pets’ vocalization ".... There's something wrong here, perhaps it's grammatical or lexical. Hard to say but not the best opening for a technical paper. More importantly, your paper does not say why this research is useful or meaningful. What problem are you trying to solve -- or are you just trying to find the answer to a yes/no question out of curiosity

4. Reproducibility Does the paper provide enough information to be reproducible? If not, please explain (It may help to consult the paper’s reproducibility checklist.)
No

5. Resources Are there novel resources (e.g., datasets) the paper contributes? (It might help to consult the paper’s reproducibility checklist)
No

6. Ethical considerations Does the paper adequately address the applicable ethical considerations, e.g., responsible data collection and use (e.g., informed consent, privacy), possible societal harm (e.g., exacerbating injustice or discrimination due to algorithmic bias, etc.)? If not, explain why not. Does it need further specialized ethics review?
This paper would deserve a dedicated section on the ethical implications, instead of so much about the dataset. Privacy, dog racism, who knows.

7. OVERALL EVALUATION Please provide your overall evaluation of the paper, carefully weighing the reasons to accept and the reasons to reject the paper.
Strong Reject: For instance, a paper with trivial results, limited novelty, poor impact, or unaddressed ethical considerations.

8. CONFIDENCE How confident are you in your evaluation?
Quite confident. I tried to check the important points carefully. It is unlikely, though conceivable, that I missed some aspects that could otherwise have impacted my evaluation.
