<!--        <p>What animals are talking about is a fascinating research topic. Previous work in bio-acousitics studied a handful of species and has suffered from limited scale and high cost. Furthermore, no previous research has attempted to adopt a systematic approach to associate animal vocal sounds with written symbols, and meanings like we do with human languages. </p>-->
<!--        <p>In our preliminary study, we have built a pipeline of acquiring dog videos from YouTube, cleaning and segmenting the audio and video tracks of the animals, and transcribing the vocals into a sequence of predefined phonetic symbols. Based on this pipeline, the undergraduate participants of REU site will make two research thrusts: i) to collect high quality, partially annotated multimedia animal communication data; and ii) to experiment on this data using our animal language processing pipeline to gain insights about the language of a new species. </p>-->
<!--        <p>To achieve these goals, we will recruit student animal lovers with computing or  biology backgrounds. Each year, participants will spend 10 weeks away from UTA learning the basics and collecting data, and 10 weeks summer time at UTA doing experiments, validating their findings and improving the pipeline. Our work eventually will develop into an open-source web-based animal language study platform called AniVoice. </p>-->

        <h1>Objectives of the Project</h1>
        <p>
          The core objective of this research initiative is to decode the complex language of animals, beginning with dogs, by leveraging advancements in machine learning and bioacoustics. This project aspires to translate canine vocalizations into a sequence of phonetic symbols and to associate these sounds with specific behaviors and contexts, creating an innovative framework akin to a lexicon of animal language. The ultimate goal is to build the AniVoice platform, an open-source, web-based resource for animal language studies that can be utilized by researchers, veterinarians, and animal enthusiasts worldwide to foster a deeper understanding of interspecies communication.

        <h1>Expected Outcome at the End</h1>
        <p>
          Upon completion, the project aims to present a revolutionary approach to animal communication, detailed documentation of the research process, a robust dataset for ongoing studies, and potentially publishable findings that contribute to the scientific community's understanding of animal linguistics.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="evaluation">
        <h1>How They Are Evaluated</h1>
        <p>
          Participants' contributions will be evaluated on the basis of technical proficiency, the accuracy and innovation of their research methods, the quality of their data analysis, and the clarity of their final presentations and documentation. Success in these areas will reflect the participant's ability to apply interdisciplinary knowledge to complex problems and generate reliable, insightful results that advance the field.

    <section id="Activity Timetable">
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Activity Timetable</h2>
      <p><b>Weekly REU Group Seminars</b>: These will be hour-long research seminars attended by all REU students, mentors, and their graduate students. Each week, two REU students will give a ten-minute presentation about a topic in their research area (which can be an introductory tutorial or about one or more research papers), and then two graduate students among the mentors will also give a similar presentation. Each mini-talk or presentation will be followed by a short Q&A session and audience feedback about their  presentation delivery. Students will broaden their knowledge of each otherâ€™s fields and improve their presentation skills.</p>
      <p><b>Weekly Project Sync-ups</b>: Each project group will meet weekly with their mentors about project progress and to resolve issues that they might have encountered. Groups which have related tasks may hold the weekly sync-ups or sessions together. </p>
      <p><b>Orientation and Lab Tours (Week 1-2)</b>: Assist UGRs to settle in to the UTA house and assign them to the workspace in the PIâ€™s and Co-PIâ€™s labs. Participants will meet mentorsâ€™ graduate students and become familiarized with the campus and surroundings. Workshops on research conduct and safety will be held. UGRs will are given a demonstration and a walk-through of the existing AniVoice pipeline and learn how to use it.</p>
      <p><b>Data Filtering, Cleansing, and Annotation (Week 3-4)</b>: UGRs will focus on putting all data collected from Phase 1 together, and apply preprocessing code to extract useful audio/visual data with actual animal communication scenes. The UGRs may also need to annotate both audio and video data for word and sub-word segmentation, video scene recognition and object recognition, etc. In the first year of the project, the group that is tasked with web development will develop a web interface that allows internet users to upload their own recordings, as well as annotate their video clips on the web. In subsequent years, the UGRs will maintain this web interface and integrate the collected data from the web platform with their own data. </p>
      <p><b>Vocal Transcription,  Semantics Discovery (Week 5-6)</b>:  After fine-tuning the word/subword segmentation models and acoustic feature extraction models, UGRs will transcribe the animal vocalizations into sequences of distinct symbols. UGRs will further finetune the video understanding and alignment models to align the words in the transcripts with the video scenes and give them semantics. </p>
      <p><b>Evaluation and Analysis (Week 7-8)</b>: UGRs will test the fine-tuned AniVoice pipeline to evaluate its ability to accurately segment, recognize, and understand animal communications within the data. These tests will help ensure the respective componentsâ€™ reliability and robustness. Statistical analysis will be performed to infer the possible meaning of the animal words, which will be validated against animal science literature. These activities will provide feedback to assess its usability and effectiveness in annotating and contributing data which will guide refinements and enhancements to AniVoice. </p>
      <p><b>Documentation and Presentation (Week 9-10)</b>: In the final two weeks, UGRs will focus on compiling documentation and preparing presentations to share their findings. UGRs will compile comprehensive documentation that encapsulates the entire research process, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, testing results, and best practices. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for future researchers. At the same time, UGRs will prepare and deliver final research presentations to showcase their accomplishments and insights gained through the program. UGRs will also produce a detailed research report summarizing their work, findings, and contributions to the AniVoice project. If such reports are deemed publication-worthy, we will carry the UGRs through the paper writing and submission process. </p>
